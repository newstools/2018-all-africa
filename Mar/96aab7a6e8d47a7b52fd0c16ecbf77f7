Fashion designer Victoria Beckham is in the country for a charity event aimed at training girls how to defend themselves in unsafe places. The project, dubbed box girls, explores "how boxing for women can help make them feel more confident." The project is funded by Comic Relief and targets girls aged eight to 18, though the location where it is being conducted remains unclear. This is Victoria second tour in Kenya.
