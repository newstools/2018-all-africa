CHINESE nationals named on the list of looters recently published will face the full wrath of the law despite the fact their government stood by the Zimbabwean government in difficulty times when the West imposed illegal sanctions on the country, President Emmerson Mnangagwa said. Mnangagwa told delegates Wednesday when he commissioned the Kariba South hydro-power extension project which was funded by China Exim Bank that no one is above the law. The President also said he will be in China in the first week of April at the invitation of the Chinese President to update him on various issues. Chinese national retails and mining companies dominated the list of about 600 names of looters who externalised over $1.3 billion during toppled former president Robert Mugabe's reign. The Asians had ignored a three and half month amnesty granted by the new government. "As long you operate in this country the laws of this country must be obeyed by everybody and that is the rule whether you are Chinese or not and those Chinese named will be prosecuted," said Mnangagwa. The biggest alleged Chinese looter cited on the list was Jinan Mining Company which externalised $333 million. Mnangagwa also said that he is happy with how the money on the Kariba project was used. "I also want to say that the loan facility is the money well spent this government is happy about the financial aid was handled and used," he said. "Sunday I again will be leaving for China at the invitation of the president of Peoples Republic of the China and among other issues that I am going to discuss with him are the successful implementation of this program (the 300 megawatt hydro-extension project." He added, "I am going to tell him about Hwange 7 and 8 and that this same company is going to be involved in that project and it is being financed by the People's Republic of China."
