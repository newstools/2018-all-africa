When Rwanda hosts big events, such as the recently concluded Tenth Extra-Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union, little is said about the events that keep the guests entertained. Nyundo School of Music's band and the National Ballet, Urukerereza, made a name for themselves as the entertainers of high profile guests with their creative performances that gave guests a 'glimpse of Rwandan culture'. Those who attended the dinner hosted by President Paul Kagame and First Lady Jeannette Kagame on Tuesday on the opening day of the summit were amazed by the performances. During the dinner, the students relived classic hits not only from Rwanda, but also from across the region and continent to relate with the guests from all over Africa, including Heads of State from different African countries. On the final day, Nyundo Choir did a rendition of the African Union anthem. Students sang several songs, including Bob Marley's "One Love", in the background as dignitaries signed the agreements, which according to Jacques "Mighty Popo" Murigande, the director of the music school, was 'a key milestone' for the kids. "This was a fantastic opportunity for our students, and it means the organisers had trust in the band that they would give a great performance," said Mighty Popo. He added: "It's not the first time the students have performed at such important events in Kigali. In 2016, at the 27th African Union Summit in Kigali, the student's choir performed the AU anthem and traditional Rwandan songs. Meanwhile, the school recently relocated from Rubavu to former Kavumu College of Education in Muhanga District, and the number of students enrolling is said to have since increased.
