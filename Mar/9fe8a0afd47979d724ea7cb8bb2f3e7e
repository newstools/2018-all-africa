President Yoweri Museveni has summoned Bank of Uganda Governor Tumusiime-Mutebile and the Inspector General of Government Irene Mulyagonja for a meeting to defuse the escalating tension between the two principals. Mutebile and Mulyagonja have been embroiled in an antagonistic public exchange that was triggered by a contested reshuffle of senior executives and staff at the central bank earlier this year.
