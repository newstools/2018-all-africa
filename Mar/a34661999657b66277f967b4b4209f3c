Dar es Salaam â€” Acacia Mining Company has trimmed the number of foreign workers by 85 per cent worldwide over the last five years. This has been possible thanks to company's Rainbow Leadership Development training Programme. The internal training Programme is delivered through a series of class lectures, examinations and workplace assignments. Through the programme, Acacia has trained leaders across a range of specialisations including mining, engineering (mechanical, electrical, civil), metallurgy, geology, and environment.

He added that the ceremony held on Friday evening in Mwanza, marked the fourth round of graduations from the company's Rainbow Programme.
