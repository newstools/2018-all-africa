A heavy gunfight was reported broke out between Somali government forces and suspected Al Shabaab suspects in northern Mogadishu on Wednesday night. The skirmish erupted at a military base near the former candy factory in Heliwa district following an ambush by the assailants thought to be militants from Al Shabaab. The local residents reported a heavy gunfire raged on for several minutes at the army camp manned by Mogadishu's Stabilization Unit forces. It was not immediately clear the exact number of the casualty figures as result of the overnight firefight in the capital, but, police say the situation has returned too normal. Mogadishu has witnessed a surge in attacks, including car bombing by Al Shabaab, a militant group linked with Al Qaeda over the past few weeks amid political crises in the country.
