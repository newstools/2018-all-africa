Kampala â€” Standard Bank raised over USD7bn of debt for African clients from global markets in 2017, driven by strong international investor appetite for Africa. The funds raised will drive further growth for Standard Bank's African clients on the continent, from supporting 800,000 cocoa farmers in Ghana with a USD1.3bn trade finance facility to funding acquisitions and helping African corporates grow on the global stage. This was the case with a USD550m debut Eurobond for Liquid Telecom and a USD1bn Eurobond for Sibanye-Stillwater. "With emerging markets sentiment remaining positive and interest rates within developed markets at historical lows, we are continuing to see strong appetite from international investors for high quality debt from Africa, which offers attractive returns," says Megan McDonald, Head: Investment Banking, International at Standard Bank Group. "Standard Bank Group's international presence and capabilities in key financial centres across the globe, alongside our footprint in Africa, provides African clients with unparalleled access to global markets and the world's biggest investors. Through these deals, we are assisting our clients in raising the necessary funding to fulfil their growth ambitions. These strategically important transactions will result in real change for the lives of Africans across the continent that we call home."
