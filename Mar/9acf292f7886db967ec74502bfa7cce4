Nigeria's former president Olusegun Obasanjo has said he wanted Zimbabwe's former president Robert Mugabe and his political opponent Joshua Nkomo to kill each other - "I had them sitting beside me. I had two pistols loaded so I said to them, 'I will give you each a gun so you can fight. The one who dies we will bury him here while the one who wins will go and fight the struggle," said Obasanjo.
