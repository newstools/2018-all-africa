Zinara allocated the municipality $182 367 for road maintenance and $293 866 for the purchase of road construction equipment under the Emergency Roads Rehabilitation Programme. Zinara technical director engineer Moses Juma said Chitungwiza was expected to have completed the repairs within the next 100 days. "Following validation exercise for the 2018 Emergency Roads Rehabilitation Programme, we have approved your 100-day work plan which forms the first phase of 2018 works," he said.  "Your allocation which was approved as per submitted Bills of Quantities (BOQ) is amounting to $182 367 to be used on three roads." Roads to be repaired are Mutasu, Hombarume and Mukomborerwa. Chitungwiza Municipality public relations officer Mr Lovemore Meya confirmed the development, saying the allocation came at an opportune time.
