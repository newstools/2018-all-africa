Addis Ababa University (AAU) plans to open Asian Studies Research Center which it said will help the country in studying and analyzing some of the models of developments and other aspects adopted from Asian countries. Professionals have already been trained abroad and facilities are in mobilization to materialize the Center in three years of time, AAU Center for African and Oriental Studies, Asian Desk Coordinator, Dr. Samuel Tefera told The Ethiopian Herald recently. In addition to adopting the Asian development models, the country should continue its national capacity to further study and utilize them, he added. Hence the Center would bridge this gap by giving training on MA level for students enrolled in the areas, Dr. Samuel said. "The University has been working with pertinent bodies and few Asian countries similar academic institutions prior to the establishment of the center." The plan is part of the Study efforts to build national capacity and promote expertise analysis thereby producing trained manpower in various areas considered essential in the country's socio-economic development, Dr. Samuel added.
