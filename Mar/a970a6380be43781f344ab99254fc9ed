A statue was erected to Menelik II in 1930 at Menelik square in Addis Ababa. It was designed and made by German Architect Curtin Specingler and unveiled in 1931. The message on the statue reads: "It is not greatness to hail from a prominent family, greatness (triumph) is to contribute something valuable to the motherland." The message is clearly written to portray the victory of blacks over white opressors--it shows that the color of skin does not make one race superior and another inferior. Aba Dagnew was Menelik's horse's name. And it stands on its two legs and face to the north--to signify the direction of the battle field. The place Menelik II Square, formerly Adawa square, was dedicated to erect the statue owing to its location as downtown of the city during the time, Addis Ababa City Administration Culture and Tourism Bureau Intangible Heritages Senior Expert Memhir Mekibib Gebremariam indicates. Generally, Menelik II statue and Adwa Bridge, around Megenagna, are among the known memorials of the victory of Adwa in Addis Ababa. Memhir Mekibib underlines the fact that Addis ought to see more memorials to inherit the sprites to posterity and demonstrate the history to visitors.
