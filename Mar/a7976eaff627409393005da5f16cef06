Motorists have been urged to use alternate routes on the Nakuru Highway, especially those going to or coming from Kisii and Narok after a section of the Narok-Mai Mahiu road collapsed during heavy rains. Major roads and highways, including Mombasa Road, Uhuru Highway, Jogoo road and Limuru Road were also adversely affected.
