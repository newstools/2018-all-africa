Nairobi â€” East African Breweries Limited (EABL) joined the global community to mark World Water Day by planting 2,000 trees at the Ndakaini Dam, Murang'a County. Speaking during the event, Keriako Tobiko, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Environment commended EABL's efforts and acknowledged the impact it will have in reversing environmental degradation. "This initiative fits perfectly with the national tree planting exercise that we launched two weeks ago; it is part of a strategic campaign to increase forest cover to 10 percent by the year 2022," noted Tobiko. "We hope other organizations will see this as a challenge and take it up. We also welcome more of these initiatives and guarantee you our full support. I believe that through concerted efforts, we will be able to do great things and change our environment for good," he added. The event attracted over 200 EABL staff who are part of a staff driven initiative dubbed Kijani that is involved in environmental conservation through tree planting across the country. EABL's Group Chairman Charles Muchene said that tree planting as a fast and sure way of restoring nature and bringing back the balance in our ecosystem. "Water is a key ingredient in all of our products, and the growing water scarcity is not just an issue for our company, it is also a risk to millions of people in the communities where we live and work. We are here to demonstrate that nature-based solutions are able to solve many of our water challenges," said Muchene. "At EABL, reducing environmental impact is one of the key pillars of our elaborate sustainability strategy geared towards promoting environmental conservation. So far, we have planted and nurtured over one million tree seedlings, whose success rate is 85% success rate, "he added. EABL has also collaborated with Nature Kenya with the aim of restoring 250 acres of Mount Kenya Forest, by planting 100,000 tree seedlings in the next two years.
