Proceeds from illegal logging and charcoal burning inside the Boni Forest are being used to fund terrorists, the authorities say. Al Shabaab is also benefiting from the sale of game meat by the Boni community. A crackdown on the loggers and charcoal burners have been launched. Speaking during the launch, Lamu police commander Muchangi Kioi said security officers in the Linda Boni operation will work closely with police to end the illegal trade. He said areas, where the trade was taking place, have had frequent al Shabaab attacks. Kioi said al Shabaab sympathizers were endangering the lives of innocent Kenyans. He said it was unfortunate that residents were still supporting terrorists. "The fact that people burn charcoal and cut timber to fund such terrorist acts is unimaginable. We can't have such activities going on here," Kioi said.
