Kampala â€” THOUSANDS of Ugandans rendered homeless by recent floods are living under dire conditions and at risk of a cholera crisis. The flooding along Sebeya River and resultant mudslides had a devastating impact of the lives of 25 000 people, or 5 000 households, in the Rubavu District, located in the Western Province. Homeless families are accommodated in the nearby communities after their homes were either destroyed or damaged by flowing water and mud debris. The flash floods caused five severe injuries, flooded farmlands, washed away 643 livestock, demolished ten bridges and a school. The International Federation of Red Cross lamented that more houses were likely to succumb to the torrential rains. "If they remain flooded for a longer period, many others are likely to fall down or become uninhabitable in coming days," the organisation stated. The Red Cross raised concern that with the water supply system interrupted, people were forced to look for alternative and unsafe sources of water, thus increasing the risk of waterborne diseases. In addition, the sanitation infrastructures were affected by flowing waters whereby 356 latrines were completely destroyed and the faecal waste mixed with rain water. "This remains a threat to the affected population and requires rapid response, to avoid diarrhoea or a cholera outbreak," the Red Cross warned. There is also concern regarding the helpless people including the chronically ill, elderly, lactating mothers, pregnant women and children who were already living in vulnerability conditions.
