SERENGETI Breweries Limited has come up with a programme to support farmers with free highquality seeds and link them to financial institution so as to acquire large scale farming. The Corporate Relation Director John Wanyancha said during the Parliamentary Budget Committee held at SBL Plant in Mwanza over the weekend that the brewer currently supports a network of 300 farmers across the country with plans to expand to 450 in the coming two years. He added that, SBL buys all that is produced from the farmers thus enabling them to repay borrowed capital to raise the living standard and their dependants. According to him, agribusiness project by SBL aimed to facilitate framers growing maize, sorghum and millet in various parts in the country has enabled the beer maker to increase its locally sourced raw materials to 15,000 tonnes which is equivalent to 80 per cent of all raw material the company uses in beer production annually
