Dar es Salaam â€” In efforts to boost entrepreneurship in Tanzania, the minister for Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, Ms Ummy Mwalimu has directed all district executive directors to allocate land for small businesses. Speaking during the launch of a book titled "Breaking the Chain of Poverty-With Empowered World View" in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday, Ms Mwalimu said it would help the growth of industries and small businesses. "I direct all district councils to allocate land for small businesses and industries as we strive to eradicate poverty. These will also help in job creation," she said. The book among other things, features testimonies of people who were poor, but through the World Vision's positive mind-set programme, they became successful small entrepreneurs. "Positive mind-set can lead people to success," the minister said. She called on Tanzanians to work hard, save earnings and invest meaningfully in order to improve their livelihoods. "Some people are complaining that the government is causing them poverty, but it is not true, it is weakness of the mind that causes poverty," she said. World Vision Tanzania former director Tim Andrew said the positive mind programme has a long journey and has produced positive results in the country. Mr Andrew said the programme was aimed at enabling people to get out of dependence, which is a major factor for poverty. "The mind transformation programme aimed at breaking psycho-poverty. We have managed to enable subsistence farmers to grow and become small commercial farmers," said Mr Andrew. The ex-director said through the programme, they trained farmers on modern farming practices, link them with financial services, insurance services and connect them to the market. The training is based on entrepreneurship skills that enables the farmers to produce crops not only for personal consumption, but also for sale. They also trained them on proper ways of keeping livestock to boost their income.
