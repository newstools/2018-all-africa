It's never too early for a young girl to find her purpose and pursue her dreams as she becomes a woman. Today we celebrate 11 year old South African writer Stacey Fru, an author of two books who also runs a YouTube edutain channel. At seven years old, Stacey Fru was South Africa's youngest author. She had written a book Smelly Cats which was launched at the University of Witwatersrand. The illustrated 108 pages book was written by Stacey without the knowledge of her parents. Stacey's second book came when she was eight, Bob and the Snake. Smelly Cats was chosen by the Department of Basic Education to act as supplementary reading material at primary school. Stacey is just not a writer, she's also a motivational speaker. With a strong grounding in reading and writing, Stacey plans to write 12 books by the time she's in Grade 10. The young writer has different messages that she delivers through her writing. She hopes to get more children to read and write, and to inspire everyone to read. Stacey is a presenter at the Children Television South Africa (CTVSA) a station that educates and entertains children. She conceived of the station some months after the Stacey Fru Foundation was established. Her vision for CTVSA is to grow minds. The young wordsmith was named by the Mail & Guardian as part of the top 200 influential young South Africans in 2017.
