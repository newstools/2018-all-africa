Cape Town â€” CAPE Town and Johannesburg are among the first sub-Saharan Africa cities to have 100 gigabit per second (Gbps) ethernet technology deployed. SEACOM, the Pan-African telecom company, has deployed the technology in its internet protocol (IP)/ multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) data centre core points of presence (PoPs) in Teraco's establishments in the two cities. This is part of SEACOM's ongoing investment in capacity for future expansion. Mark Tinka, Head of Engineering at SEACOM, said the investment would enable the company grow its network and customer base, while continuing to provide a reliable and consistent experience to African businesses, service providers and consumers. "Africa is becoming an important global player in the digital age, and we are committed to investing in the best technology to support the growth of Internet access across the continent," Tinka said. By upgrading its core routers and switches at these Teraco PoPs to 100Gbps Ethernet technology, SEACOM has activated up to 400Gbps of routing and switching bandwidth at each facility. SEACOM will be able to scale both PoPs to 3.2 Tbps and beyond. The upgrade also enables SEACOM to scale up the capacity it has acquired on the WACS undersea cable to provide alternate traffic paths in the case of a SEACOM subsea cable system outage.
