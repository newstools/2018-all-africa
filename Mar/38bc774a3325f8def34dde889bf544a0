Dar es Salaam â€” The government has received a grant of Sh77.3 billion from Japan to finance construction of a 4.3-kilometre stretch of the new Bagamoyo Road, phase II between Morocco and Mwenge junction. Ministry of Finance and Planning permanent secretary Doto James said in Dar es Salaam that the road will be widened to a four lane highway including enough space for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) phase 4. "Widening of this road is vital for alleviating traffic congestion in Dar es Salaam, as well as connecting Bagamoyo Port for the purpose of transporting goods and services within and around Dar es Salaam, and the rest of the country," he said. Mr James said the government of Japan also financed the detailed design to a tune of Sh1.4 billion. He explained that Japan has been financing a number of projects including Sh99.5 billion for the upgrading of a 12.9 kilometres section between Mwenge junction and Tegeta junction to four lanes as well as replacement of bridges at Mlalakuwa, Lugalo and Tegeta. He said other projects financed by Japan include construction of Tazara flyover, 188.15 kilometres of the Dodoma-Babati road, 202.5 kilometres of Tunduru-Mangaka-Mtambaswala road and 259.9 kilometres of the Iringa-Dodoma road. Japanese ambassador Masaharu Yoshida said the grant especially targets the area because it's one of the highly congested parts in the city. "Traffic jam is one of the challenges to address immediately here in Dar es Salaaam, which is was home to around 4 million in 2012, but it will be home to 12 million come 2040," he said. Speaking on the sidelines of the meeting, Tanzania National Roads Agency (Tanroads) CEO Patrick Mfugale said that the government has received a soft loans from World Bank and African Development Bank (AfDB) for the construction of phases I and II. "We have finalised feasibility studies for both phase II and III of BRT and we are currently implementing the feasibility study for phase IV," he said.
