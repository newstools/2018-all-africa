Burlian, reportedly said: "Over the years, we have bought huge amount of crude oil from Nigeria. We are extremely happy to buy more Nigerian crude oil which is globally rated to be of very high grade and which is very suitable for our refineries." He said they were also interested in investment opportunities in the Nigerian upstream, midstream and downstream petroleum sectors. According to the statement, the Group General Manager, Crude Oil Marketing Division (COMD) of the corporation, Mr. Mele Kyari, who was represented by Mr Adokiye Tombomieye, responded on behalf of the NNPC, and explained it would continue to supply crude oil to Indonesia.
