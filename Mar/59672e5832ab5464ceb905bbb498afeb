Big Brother Naija 2018 themed Double wahala, which is the third season, kicked off on the 28th of January this year. The housemates would be spending 85 days in the house with a twist; they would be competing in pairs in order to survive the weekly nominations and evictions. They would be competing for a large cash prize and the most favourite housemate with the most votes from the public will take home an SUV and N45 million prize at the end of the game. A short interview was carried out and here are the reactions towards the show. Kola Badmus: "The Big Brother show is a total waste of time and very unproductive. Only people with so much time on their hands will engage in watching the show." Amarachi Okoye: "I think the show is very interesting and compared to last year's show, there is enough drama in the house this year because of the pairing of the housemates." Sheye Bankole: "I don't really enjoy the show only when I get to see it on social media. And all the funny comments I get to read online about the housemates." Williams Oladiran: "I'm very indifferent about the show. I mostly watch their Saturday night party and Sunday eviction show. I think the show is a great platform to advertise your brand as a person." Jessica Okuola: "I watch the show and it a great platform but it doesn't have so many positive things that it promotes." Dora Thomas: "I watch their daily highlights and read comments on social media because of the very funny comments I get to read. This year, there is a whole lot of drama in the house."
