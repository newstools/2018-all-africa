The first edition of Seka Live Festival was held on Sunday, March 25 at the Kigali Conference and Exhibition Village (Camp Kigali). Led by Nigerian sensational comedian Klint Da Drunk, the sold out show did not in any way disappoint revellers be it at the organisational level or the performances. The show started at 7:30pm, with each comedian taking to the stage to display their jokes. The show was packed with some of the biggest and funniest acts in comedy, who came to keep the crowd entertained, they included Tanzanian comedian and Big Brother Africa-Hotshots 2014 winner Idris Sultan, Kigingi from Burundi, German-based Tanzanian comedian Captain Khalid, Eric Omondi and Chipukeezy both from Kenya, and Kigali's very own Arthur Nkusi, the brain behind the comedy festival. It was full entertainment for the audience, who had enormous fun enjoying different types of comedy from the talented rib crackers. While all comedians received positive reception from the audience for their jokes, Klint Da Drunk and Uganda's Patrick Idringi, best known as Salvado were especially outstanding. Most of the jokes were about Rwanda's "exceptionally beautiful girls", relationships, Kigali's cleanliness and tidiness, as well as contemporary issues such as the economy. The show was made even more glorious as veteran Tanzanian singer Mr. Nice crowned the night with an excellent performance, leading the audience through the merry dance of his legendary hits Fagilia and First Lady that left his audience yearning for more. The Sunday show was the climax of the Seka Live Festival, which kicked off on Saturday March 24, with "Comedy on the bus". The festival was organised by Arthur Nation, a local entertainment company founded by local comedian and radio personality Arthur Nkusi.
