The United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia [UNSOM] has vehemently condemned Sunday's car bomb attack in Mogadishu, the capital city of the Horn of Africa country. UNSOM said in a Twitter post that the terrorist attack at a security checkpoint near the parliament building will never diminish resilience of Somali people. The UN has also extended condolences to families of victims of the latest attack by Al Shabaab militants in Mogadishu. The attack has left at least four people dead. A bomber rammed his explosives-laden vehicle at the main security checkpoint outside the headquarters of the Ministry of Interior, close to Villa Somalia, the Presidential Palace. The incident was the latest in series of car bombings in the capital amidst tight security and routine security operations by Somali government forces backed by African Union troops.
