The producers of the film, Inxeba, will on Tuesday ask the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria to get its porn rating overturned. In a statement released by Mad Moth Communications, David Alex Wilson said the producers of the film, through their attorneys Webber Wentzel, served a lawsuit on February 24 seeking an urgent interdict to overturn the reclassification of the film. The Film and Publication Board Appeals Tribunal overturned the original classification of the 16LS and gave the film a rating of X18, classifying the film in the same category as hardcore pornography, Wilson said. The film about a gay relationship set in the context of a Xhosa initiation ceremony, was pulled from cinemas after being slapped with a X18 classification. Source: News24
