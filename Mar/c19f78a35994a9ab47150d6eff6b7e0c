In a world where extreme weather events, animal extinction and plastic pollution seem to a headline in every other news cycle, it's important that we stop to ask: what can we do? And whereas these are conversations that need to happen in governments and through conservation bodies in order to have a global impact, it's also important that it is reflected in our lifestyle choices and how we choose to run own homes. Whether we acknowledge it or not, our decision today will ultimately affect our children and tomorrow. Two years ago, the death of Sudan (the last male white rhino) would have been nothing but a Twitter hashtag, a moment on my timeline that may have caused me to stop and think about it for a second but nothing more. Today, knowing that my daughter will never get to see an animal that I had the pleasure of meeting and experiencing in my lifetime fills me with a deep sadness; but more so, a sense of responsibility to ensure she inherits a world that I would be proud to leave behind.
