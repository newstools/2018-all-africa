In December 2016, Sandra van Neel was admitted to Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital where she was told she had meningitis. She died four days later after a subsequent diagnosis revealed the cause of her illness to be listeriosis. Her story, as told to Bhekisisa, comes after the National Institute for Communicable Diseases said the disease, linked to polony products produced by Enterprise which van Neel regularly bought, led to the deaths of 180 people.
