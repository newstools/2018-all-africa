Buganda Road Chief Magistrate's Court has threatened to dismiss a case against two local musicians accused of disturbing President Museveni' peace through a song. David Mugema and Jonathan Muwangunzi are charged with offensive communication and abetting offensive communication. In a session presided over by Grade One magistrate Gladys Kamasanyu, the state prosecutor, Mr Abdul Salam Waiswa, told court that he did not have the case file because he lost touch with the investigating officer. "I don't know the status of the case because we lost touch with the investigating officer," Mr Waiswa told court. This prompted Ms Kamasanyu to give state the last adjournment to April 13 with an order that failure for prosecution to present witnesses will lead to dismissal of the case. Prosecution states that the two artists between 2015 and 2017 at Salama road Makindye division in Kampala District unlawfully and repeatedly composed, recorded, produced and electronically communicated through social media a song entitled " Mzee Wumula" where they attacked the person and age of the President Museveni.
