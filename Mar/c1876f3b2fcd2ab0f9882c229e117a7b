South African activist Johan Pienaar has been granted a court order preventing controversial Afrikaans singer, Steve Hofmeyr, from intimidating him and disturbing his art installation which features the old South African flag. Hofmeyr, who sees himself as the "voice" of the white Afrikaner people in South Africa, has his name featured in the middle of the flag. The artist has been inviting people at the exhibition to walk over the piece as a symbol of rejection.
