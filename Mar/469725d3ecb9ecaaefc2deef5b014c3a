Kampala â€” The Nation Media Group - Uganda will tomorrow start a public road user campaign in which it will publish photographs and videos of errant road users as a way of curbing indiscipline on the roads. The campaign dubbed "Stay in Your Lane" will see photographs and videos of errant road users published in Daily Monitor newspaper, NTV and all their online platforms. Registration numbers (and names of errant motorists or registered owner) will be mentioned on KFM and Dembe FM - location of offence and type of misdemeanour. Mr Charles Bichachi, the Monitor Publications Limited executive editor, said the campaign is intended to educate motorists on the traffic rules. "We want to revisit the rules of driving so that everyone can be safe on the road. The problem on the road is not that drivers do not know the rules; it is just impunity because some think they are above the law or can get away with it," Mr Bichachi said yesterday. He added that by naming and shaming errant motorists, "we hope others with intention of breaking traffic laws will reconsider the acts." "We call upon the travelling public to join us and share photographs or videos of errant motorists wherever you sight them. Send images and short text detailing the offence, time and place to editorial@ug.nationmedia.com or WhatsApp ... 0776769334... ," Mr Bichachi said. Mr Maurice Mugisha, the NTV Uganda News Manager, said the rate of indiscipline on the road is a great concern and the media needs to do something to arrest the situation. "We will be exposing the undisciplined drivers on the road and also highlighting advantages of observing basic traffic regulations that will go a long way in bringing sanity on our roads," Mr Mugisha said. Police spokesman Emilian Kayima welcomed the initiative saying they will use the photographs and videos as evidence to prosecute the culprits.
