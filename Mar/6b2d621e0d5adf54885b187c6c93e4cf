The official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, will lay criminal charges of money laundering and corruption against the Bank of Baroda, India's largest bank, following allegations that they deliberately laundered money on behalf of the Gupta family. The Guptas are implicated in the State of Capture Report released by former public protector Thuli Madonsela, in which it was alleged that they had an influence on key Cabinet appointments made by former president Jacob Zuma, a close family friend.
