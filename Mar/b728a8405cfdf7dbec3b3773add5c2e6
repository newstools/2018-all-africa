This year's edition tagged 'The Gidi Tribe' will take place at the Hard Rock Caf√© Beach Front on Good Friday, March 30, 2018. The headliners will be flanked by some of the most sought after Nigerian acts making waves across the globe, including Maleek Berry, Ycee, Adekunle Gold, Brymo, Show Dem Camp and Mayorkun. According to Chin Okeke, co-founder of Eclipse Live and Gidi Fest., the 2018 edition of the festival will bring with it changes and additions, as well as a theme that celebrates the African youth. "This year's theme, 'The Gidi Tribe' is an evolution of the identity that has found a home in Gidi Fest. The Tribe represents the new African generation that refuse to be defeated or defined by their circumstances. It's an emergence of young, determined individuals who refuse to take no for an answer coming together to break down boundaries and rewrite the status quo."
