Award-winning studio Aardman has teamed up with the global campaign, Malaria Must Die So Millions Can Live, to call on leaders to "unite and fight" the disease that takes the life of a child every two minutes. The animation, voiced by actor Hugh Laurie, takes viewers through the history of the disease from the first recorded case in ancient China to the current day.
