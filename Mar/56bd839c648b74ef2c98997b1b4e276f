Abuja â€” Nigerian troops have killed ten herdsmen and arrested six others blamed for recurring violence northeast of the volatile country. Army officials reported the nomadic herdsmen were terrorising villagers at Gwamba in the Numan local government area of Adamawa State earlier this week. Troops of the Battalion on Exercise Ayem Akpatuma (Cat Race) were deployed in response to a distress call following the attack at the village. It is the latest in a series of clashes between herdsmen and villagers over land. "Despite swift reaction to rescue the village from destruction, the notorious herdsmen set the village ablaze before troops' arrival," said Brigadier General Texas Chukwu, the Director of Nigerian Army Public Relations. He said the six suspects were arrested while trying to flee. "During the process of the arrest, the herdsmen showed resistance, which made the alerted troops to engage them and kill ten of them," Chukwu said. Items recovered from the herdsmen include an AK 47 rifle, 41 rounds of ammunition, a locally made rifle, a cutlass, clothes suspected to be looted and a motorcycle. Violence between the cattle rearers and villagers have claimed hundreds of lives in recent months. Adamawa is also one of northeastern states- alongside Borno and Yobe- experiencing attacks by Boko Haram, the Islamic terror group. The militants kidnapped over 100 girls from a school in Yobe last week.
