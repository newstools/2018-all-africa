Trustco Group Holdings has received backlash for an online advert that depicts American transgender and reality TV personality Caitlyn Jenner wearing a lingerie top and standing next to men wearing executive suits in the background, followed by a caption, "some will do anything to get a seat." The Insurance firm's founder Quinton van Rooyen who previously praised his marketing team on social media for a "brilliant ad", has issued an apology.
