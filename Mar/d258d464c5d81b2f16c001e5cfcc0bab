Johannesburg â€” ALEXANDER Forbes has called for integrated approaches to workplace learning with traditional methods no longer responsive enough to keep up with the pace of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Ryan Knipe, Managing Executive Alexander Forbes Empower, emphasized on the need for lifelong learning, continuous upskilling and reskilling considering businesses and careers are no longer as stable as before. Knipe cites studies in the United States by San Francisco based award-winning learning platform, Degreed, which revealed that up to 85 percent of employees do not feel like the training they are getting at work is preparing them for their next position . On the other hand, 77 percent of CEOs according to PwC's annual survey said lack of key skills was a serious threat to their businesses' growth prospects. "These disconnects show that traditional approaches to education and training and to quantifying and communicating people's skills are not responsive enough to keep up with the pace of change," Knipe said. "It is for this reason that Alexander Forbes, in partnership with Degreed, has introduced a new on-line learning service that provides access to educational and skills content for both employers and employees. We are bringing a best in class life-long learning solution to enable how the workforce really learns." Headquartered in South Africa and listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Alexander Forbes is a specialised financial services group. It focuses on employee benefits solutions for institutional clients, and financial well-being and retail financial solutions for individual clients, in particular employees of the Group's institutional clients.
