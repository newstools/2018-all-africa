Bangui â€” A REBEL leader is holding five children hostage and demanding ransom for their release in one of the most recent grave violations in the ungovernable Central African Republic (CAR). The minors were abducted in the south eastern Bangassou this past weekend alongside a Catholic priest who has since been released. However, the rebel leader's AB militants have retained the priest's car as a means of negotiation for the release of the youngsters who had been brought under the churchman's care in late February. "The children are still in the hands of the AB leader. He has set a number of conditions for their release, including the payment of a ransom," said a spokesperson of MINUSCA. Another Catholic priest is meanwhile among over 20 people, including combatants and civilians, killed since last week after fighting between elements of two rival armed groups in the central Ippy region. Houses have been set alight and entire villages forced to flee to the bushes. A person has been killed and two women abducted in the central Yalinga after elements of the Lord Resistance Army rebel movement struck the city. The majority of Yalinga's population, estimated at 6 000, has reportedly taken refuge in the bushes. In volatile Bria, the situation remains tense after MINUSCA forces arrested two influential leaders of an armed group destabilising the local refugee camp. There has been exchange of gunfire between militants and peacekeepers following the arrests while MINUSCA has unearthed and destroyed a weapons manufacturing centre for rebels. Anarchy by Christian extremists and Muslim radicals is tearing the Central African country apart.
