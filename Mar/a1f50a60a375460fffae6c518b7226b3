Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy specialising in mining and analysing data is accused of interfering in elections in Nigeria and Kenya. Their claims are overstated, the writers of The Conversation Africa piece believe. "This is not to say that Cambridge Analytica doesn't present a threat to democracy, or that it should not be ashamed of itself or face investigation. But it is to say that its impact in Africa has been over-hyped because it serves a variety of interests to do so."
