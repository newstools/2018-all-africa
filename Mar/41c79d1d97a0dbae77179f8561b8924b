Contrary to expectations, modular refineries will not address refining product gap in the country, Minister of State ,petroleum, Ibe Kachikwu has said. He spoke to State House correspondents yesterday after the federal executive council meeting presided over by vice President, Yemi Osinbajo at the presidential Villa. According to him, the product gaps will be covered by the Warri, Kaduna, Port Harcourt and Dangote refineries. He explained that modular refineries are meant to address the supply needs of communities which engage in illegal refineries. He said "modular wasnt supposed to provide a sufficient solution to your product needs, modulars are on the average between 2000 and 5000 maybe 10,000 at most capacity per refinery "Your consumption is about 630,000 barrels per day, that is not the essence of modular, what modular was supposed to do for us is provide work within some of these communities where people are busy doing illegal refining, it's not meant to address the refining product gap we have in the country. "We are hoping that those gaps will be covered by a mixture of the three or four refineries that government owns currently, Warri, Port Harcourt and Kaduna and of course the Dangote refinery of 600 barrels. On fixing the refineries, he said "as a seasoned professional I have given all the guardance that is required to fix the refineries , we came into a situation where we don't have money to fix the refineries we had to raise the money looking into the PPP model."It has to go through a process the technical committee is headed by NNPC, obviously the submit their report to the board when they complete their work, so from a governance and guidance sense, steering point of view. " I think that steering is right on track, from a management of the technical aspect of the contracting, that is something we would have to allow NNPC handle, it is not the job of the ministry to superimpose, you got to let them do their work and do it efficiently," he stated.
