As the American Secretary of State Rex Tillerson prepared to leave for a five-nation trip to East Africa, the Sahel and Nigeria, he outlined the current administration's concerns for the continent, and the head of the U.S. military in Africa, General Thomas Waldhauser, reported to Congress.  While both Tillerson and Waldhauser, in line with the Trump administration's focus on U.S. military activity in Africa, dealt at length with counter-terrorism initiatives,Â  Tillerson also ranged widely on other issues, such humanitarian assistance, trade, energy and democracy-building. He also attacked China's approach to Africa. Discussing China's new military base in Djibouti, Waldhauser said more Chinese bases were likely to be established on the East African coast.
