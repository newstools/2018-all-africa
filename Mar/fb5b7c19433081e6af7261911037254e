Johannesburg — THE just-ended Mobile World Congress (MWC) held in Spain has been hailed as a success following the attendance of more than 107 000 visitors from 205 countries and territories. The mobile industry's premier annual event hosted in Barcelona attracted 7 700 chief executive officers (CEOs) up from 6 100 in 2017. Approximately 24 percent of attendees were female, an increase from 23 percent at MWC 2017. Additionally, 28 percent of speakers in the conference programme were female, compared with 21 percent last year. More than 2 400 companies showcased products and services compared to over 2 300 in 2017. More than 3 500 international media and industry analysts attended the event to report on the many significant industry announcements made at the congress. Preliminary independent economic analysis indicates that the event will have contributed approximately €471 million and over 13 000 part-time jobs to the local economy. "We had another highly successful Mobile World Congress, across so many fronts," says John Hoffman, Chief Executive Officer of Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA). GSMA organised the event. "We are gratified with the number of senior-level attendees, particularly the number of CEOs, as well as the continued strong attendance of government ministers and regulators."
