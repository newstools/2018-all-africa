Rwanda and Tanzania have dropped the proposed use of diesel engines in favour of electric locomotives for their Isaka-Kigali standard gauge railway. The railway from the port of Dar es Salaam to Kigali is expected to cost Rwanda and Tanzania close to U.S.$2.5 billion, according to studies. Tanzania will foot the bill of U.S.$1.3 billion while Rwanda is expected to pay U.S.$1.2 billion.
