The Command Post which is in charge of enforcing the State of Emergency (SoE) said majority of public movement in the unrest hit parts of nation have been restored to normalcy. Command Post Secretariat and Defense Minister Siraj Fegesa told a press conference yesterday that since the decree put in place, the Command Post has executed effective activities in collaboration with the public to normalize the situation in the country, he stated. Indicating that closure of main roads have disrupted movements previously, Siraj said the initial efforts of the command post have restored stability and opened transportation except the Addis Ababa-Nekemte-Asosa and Addis Ababa- Woliso-Jimma routs. The Minister added that security forces and patrols have been deployed to help these two routes open for traffic. Some social media campaigners have injected their hidden agendas in the pretext of the legitimate public demands thereby to assume power in a short but illegal way. This is totally an unacceptable move as the incumbent is the only legitimate body to administer the country; he stressed adding there is no way that the government can entertain such interested parties and foreign governments. Furthermore, the Minister underlined that the government is treating the unrest with great patience till the youth taking part in the unrest come to their senses and stop violent acts. He noted that those who thought the government is weak to contain the current problems are totally wrong. "The country has been able to maintain normal circumstances even after the Prime Minster submitted a letter resignation. "We have strong ruling party and ever strong security apparatus." The government fully acknowledges that the good governance and development demands are legitimate and should be addressed step by step, according to him.
