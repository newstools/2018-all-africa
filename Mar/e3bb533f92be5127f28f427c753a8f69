The Ekiti State Government has uncovered fresh cases of Lassa fever, which has claimed three lives.The victims were a patient who tested positive to the disease, and two others who had contact with the deceased. Commissioner for Health, Rotimi Ojo, who made this disclosure in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, said five of the eight other suspected cases in the state tested negative, one was uncertain and the last was pending as at press time.He, however, stressed that there was no cause for alarm, noting that the state government was taking proactive steps in surveillance activities that would involve all residents due to some recorded cases and deaths in neighbouring states. He assured that the State Disease Control team had been activated, while the process of sensitising the people with jingles, adverts and other communication media were ongoing. Ojo said similar actions taken during the 2016 outbreak were successful, adding that the epidemic was perfectly controlled while the patient, who was properly managed, survived. He disclosed that the isolation centre's at Ido Federal Teaching Hospital, Ido-Ekiti; Oba Adejuyigbe General Hospital and the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti were still operational.He urged health practitioners, teachers, traditional rulers, religious leaders, as well as community and opinion leaders to join hands with the state government to prevent a further spread of the disease in the state.
