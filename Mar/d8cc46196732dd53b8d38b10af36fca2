Police in Dubai are looking for a Kenyan security guard who allegedly stole more than Dirham 5 million (approximately Ksh130 million) that was on transit. Police believe the suspect is on the run in Dubai after pulling the 'Italian job' on a vehicle transporting the cash to an ATM at a shopping mall. An official from the company told Khaleej Times that they informed the police about the theft on Saturday. He said when the vehicle stopped at the mall in Deira, the Kenyan guard distracted the other guards and fled with the cash. The incident took place at 10.30pm. The police have launched a manhunt for the suspect. Theft of money in transit is very rare in Dubai, the police said. Security firms providing money transit services are trained regularly to keep a track of their employees.
