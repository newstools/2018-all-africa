The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has said that it currently spends U.S.$2.1 million every day to subsidise petrol and keep the fixed retail price at N145 per litre. Group Managing Director Maikanti Baru has said that the huge fund was as a result of the increasing number of filling stations in communities with international land and coastal borders.
