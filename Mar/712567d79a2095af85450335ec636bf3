The biggest platform for upcoming local artistes to showcase their talent will be turning four in a big way on Friday by shutting down Nairobi's City Hall Way on Friday. Industry Nite's street bash marking its fourth anniversary will bring together some of the most popular local acts and will see the road within the city's CBD sealed off from Friday 6am to Saturday 6am. Nairobi County Council on Thursday confirmed the planned road closure in a public notice published in the Daily Nation. Speaking to Nairobi News, Industry Nite CEO and Founder Sheila Kwamboka said: "We are creating an experience for campus students. The Wave street bash is the first major concert of the year. Its target audience students from campuses within Nairobi. The street bash will be held on City Hall Way." Industry Nite is a monthly event that celebrates Kenyan Music by giving a platform to artistes to perform to their fans. The platform also gives upcoming artistes a chance to showcase their talent as curtain raisers. Organisers have described the event - which started in Nairobi before spreading to over 15 counties - as an intimate unplugged event that brings the fans closer to artistes in an exclusive setting that incorporates a live band, back ground singers and dancers. Artistes lined up for this year's edition of the event include Kansol, Khaligraph Jones, Naiboi, Tunji, Monski, Jovvie Jov, Tokyo Sauce, Yvionna and Shukid. DJ Hassan Andie and DJ Bash will also be in the house.
