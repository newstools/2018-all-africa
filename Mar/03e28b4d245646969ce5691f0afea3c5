Schools from various provinces participated in the Old Mutual Schools Quiz provincial finals last weekend. Schools from eight provinces sailed through to the national finals scheduled for May 25, 2018, in Harare. Old Mutual Schools Quiz spokesperson Takudzwa Tsikwa said, the two provinces could still be allowed to host their provincial finals at later date. "We had eight provinces that took part in the Old Mutual Schools Quiz provincial finals held at the weekend. And only the top three top schools from each province would go through to the national finals set for May 25. So before May 25 we should have winners from the other two provinces," Tsikwa said. He said the winning school from each province walked away with a laptop for the quiz club to enable further research, courtesy of Old Mutual.
