Local building society CABS is partnering the Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) for 2018 and sponsoring the event's "Opera Gala Night'. The festival will this year run from the first to the sixth of May. CABS deputy managing director Mehluli Mpofu confirmed the development Wednesday in Harare during a press conference held at the National Arts Gallery. "As CABS, we are proud to be associated with this festival of art and culture that has continued to transform lives in Zimbabwe and across the continent," said Mpofu. "We are delighted once again to host the Opera Gala Night which has become an integral part of the festival. "The CABS Opera Gala showcases an evening of stunning and strong voices from internationally renowned opera stars, mixing humour with theatrical drama and exquisite singing." This year's HIFA will be graced by many artists, among them the once banned Freshly Ground pop musical outfit from Cape Town, South Africa. "CABS understands that HIFA is about giving artists an opportunity to showcase their talent, but more importantly celebrating our love for the arts and humanity as a nation," Mpofu added. The building society is one of the major sponsors for HIFA and has been sponsoring many projects in the its corporate social responsibility initiatives. HIFA Executive Director Maria Wilson called for more support for the festival where 250 foreign based-artists are expected to grace the week-long festival which is expected to feature electrical dance musical shows. "Sponsorship is a vehicle for showing how much Zimbabweans count to HIFA," said Wilson. "We are expecting 30-40 directors from across the globe and they will select artists for future festivals in their countries. "This in itself has become a form of employment for many artists, some of whom have become the world's best recognised artists," Wilson said.
