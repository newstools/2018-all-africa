Cape Town â€” SOUTH Africa will host the ninth annual Africa Peering and Interconnection Forum (AfPIF) in August. It is an apt venue being home to the oldest Internet Exchange Point (IXP) in Africa, boasting the highest density of IXPs per city and the largest carrier neutral data centre in the continent. The Internet Society and African IXP Association (AFIX) (www.AF-IX.net) will host the event in Cape Town. The conference will be held from 21-23 of August 2018 in conjunction with iWeek, South Africa's leading Internet industry conference, which will run from August 20-24. AfPIF will provide a unique opportunity for attendees to learn from its remarkable experiences and explore a growing number of opportunities in the region. Kyle Spencer, Co-Coordinator of the African IXP Association, said the African IXP Association has been amazed by South Africa's rapid development. "We all benefit from their innovation and continued success, and hope that our collective presence will provide additional momentum," Spencer said. South Africa has a thriving terrestrial infrastructure market and the continent's most mature peering ecosystem. "We are delighted to be hosting AfPIF at iWeek for the very first time. This is a fantastic example of the kind of pan-African ICT cooperation envisioned by the Abuja and OR Tambo declarations of the 1990s," said ISPA Chair, Graham Beneke. Internet Society held the first AfPIF in 2010 the from the realization that most of African internet traffic is exchanged outside the continent, and the region could save costs by exchanging the traffic locally. The target is to have at least 80 percent of the traffic consumed in Africa being locally accessible, and 20 percent sourced outside Africa by 2020. "We are getting closer to that target every year thanks to AfPIF and many activities that promote interconnection and hosting in Africa," said Dawit Bekele, Regional Bureau Director for Africa at Internet Society.
