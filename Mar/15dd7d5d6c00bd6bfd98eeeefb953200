Tanzanian actress Wema Sepetu has denied claims that she is responsible for the recent break up between Diamond Platinumz and Zari Hassan. In a media interview, Wema said video and photos of her hugging Diamond were taken during a Wasafi Records event and she had been invited as they support each other's business. "Me and Diamond have not been talking after our break up we just decided to grow up put things behind us so that life can go on. I was invited to the Wasafi event and Diamond came to say hi. Me and Diamond did not kiss, there was no public display of romance, I hug my friends and so hugging him doesn't mean we are dating," Wema said. The actress went to reveal that the two will be working together more as she is set to have a TV show on Diamond's Wasafi TV. "He is going to be my boss as I will be having a TV show on Wasafi TV," she stated. Asked why Zari could have attributed her break up with Diamond to the recent public appearance, Wema said: "She should sit down with her man and ask him exactly what is going on coz I have nothing to do with Diamond he is just my friend and we support each other, I support him, he supports me just that... We never kissed we did hug and maybe it's just the chemistry between me and him but there are no strings attached." Wema said she believes she had good chemistry with diamond because they dated, "I have been dating Diamond for a while and chemistry in relationships is common but right now there is nothing going on." The actress ended the interview by saying that she was in no position to advise Zari adding that their break up cannot be as a result of her hugging Diamond.
