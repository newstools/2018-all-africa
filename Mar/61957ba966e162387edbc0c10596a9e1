According to reports, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was in the Democratic Republic of Congo capital Kinshasa, discussed several issues with President Joseph Kabila, among them, "Zimbabwe's long-standing demand for U.S.$1 billion compensation for participating in the DR Congo war". Although diplomatic relations between the two countries have continued to be cordial, Harare and Kinshasa have a long-standing disagreement over compensating the Zimbabwean government for its active role in the 1990s war, dubbed "Africa's first world war" where Zimbabwe's decisive intervention saved Kinshasa from a military takeover by rebels backed by neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi.
