The request by Abdullah Kitatta, the patron of the Boda Boda 2010 Association, to be transferred from Makindye Military Barracks Prison, where he was remanded, to Luzira Prison has been blocked by the army court. Mr Kitatta who was appearing in the Makindye- based General Court Martial on Monday, said he has health complications which Makindye Military Barracks Prison medical officers cannot handle. However, the court chairman, Lt Gen Andrew Gutti declined to grant Kitatta's request saying he was remanded to the military barracks for his own safety and security reasons. According to Lt Gen Gutti, the Military Barracks Prison has the best health facility. As a result, Kitatta was taken to Makindye Military Police Barracks Prison while his co-accused were further remanded to Luzira as Lt Gen Gutti adjourned the case to April 23, 2018. This was after the army prosecutor, Maj Raphael Mugisha told court that investigations into the case were complete. Mr Kitatta and others are charged with unlawful possession of firearms, bullets and military uniforms which they deny. Mr Kitatta is jointly charged with 13 others. They are: John Ssebandeke, a crime preventer in Nabweru in Wakiso District, and members of Boda Boda 2010 Association; Joel Kibirige, Matia Ssenfuka, Hassan Ssebata, Jonathan Kayondo and Hassan Ssengoba. Others are; Sunday Ssemogerere, Hussein Mugema, Fred Bwanika, Amon Twinomujuni, Sowali Ngoobi and Ibrahim Sekajja.
