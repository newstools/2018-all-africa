According to Budandi, Seka Live's long term goal is to become a regular Kigali comedy festival - the Seka Live Comedy Festival that is to host "many leading comedians and happen in multiple days." "Inchoosing the comedians to headline Seka Live shows we look at those at the peak of their careers, and the ones we know Kigalians would love to see. We bring in headliners from outside the country but also provide an opportunity for Rwandan comedians and also the upcoming comedians that haven't performed on such big stages are always and will always be given a chance," he further disclosed. Both Nkusi and Budandi are already down to work, putting together logistics for the second edition of Seka Live that falls on June 4th which is expected to have Ugandan comedian Teacher Mpamire among the performers. Also on stage will be comedian Kigingi from Burundi, also one of the best from that land, and who was last on a Kigali comedy stage in 2015. Again, the respected gospel band, Beauty For Ashes will be on hand to handle the live music segment of the show, according to Nkusi. Budandi and Nkusi share a long history that predates the Komedy Knights from which most of the public got to know them. The two first met at Lyc√©e de Kigali where both attended high school. They hit it off almost immediately, performing comedy skits for classmates. Budandi wrote the skits and Nkusi acted them. After their senior six, the Komedy Knights was formed and the journey continued. "We have worked together for a long time since high school, I feel like we agree on many things plus Arthur is a very creative and hardworking individual which we have in common so it is easy to partner," said Budandi.
