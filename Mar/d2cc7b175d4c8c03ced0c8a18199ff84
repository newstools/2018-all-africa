The City of Kosti in the White Nile State last week saw a medical rare case when a woman gave birth to a baby boy with two heads. The baby was moved to the intensive care of the Khartoum Teaching Hospital. A doctor at the hospital told Sudanow the baby is now under the attention of a team of doctors. The baby was born with one body, one heart but with two heads. Previously Sudan saw two such rare births. The first case occurred in February 2014 in the Gedarif Hospital in the East when a baby girl was born with two heads. The girl died four hours after birth, according to press reports at the time. The Gedarif Hospital Director, Dr. Waleed Derzoon had, then, confirmed that the girl was in good health before she died. Dr. Derzoon had said the world had seen seven such a case before. One such a case had occurred in the U.S in 1990 and another case in Brazil in 2011. Similar cases had also been reported in Pakistan and elsewhere in the World. Most of the seven births were baby girls. Dr. Derzoon said all those babies had died at an early stage, save two cases in which the children lived for over 20 years. In 2012 a woman gave birth to a baby girl in the Soba Teaching Hospital here. The girl was born with two separate heads in one body. She used to breath and cry with both heads. She had a wide chest followed directly with a natural body. She had weighed 4.4 kilograms.
