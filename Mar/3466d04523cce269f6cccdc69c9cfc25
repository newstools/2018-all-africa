Kampala â€” Circumstance under which a member of the cabin crew of an Emirates aircraft fell out through the emergency door of a parked plane at Entebbe Airport today is being investigated. She fell off an Emirates Boeing 777 flight #EK730. Uganda's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) confirmed the incident, but while reports indicate the flight attendant was Bulgarian and has succumbed to the injuries she sustained, the official statement indicated she had been hospitalized with severe injuries. The statement did not mention reports of an attempted suicide. "An incident happened at Entebbe International Airport this afternoon as a female member of the cabin crew appeared to have opened the emergency door and unfortunately fell off an Emirates Aircraft that had safely landed and parked," the CAA statement said. According to reports, the cabin crew member who has not yet been identified was together with her colleagues preparing to board passengers for the Dubai bound aircraft.
