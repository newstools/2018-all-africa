"Depression is a significant problem that has affected some youths which has made them to be drug addicts. "Drug addiction is being experimented due to the poor state of mental health and seeks temporary pleasure and satisfaction," she said. Ms. Bubah said there cannot be health without mental health, saying one should be surrounded with positive people for well-being.
