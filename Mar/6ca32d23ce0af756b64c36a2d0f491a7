Four years in the making, the long awaited feature documentary Not in My Neighbourhood Documentary by award winning filmmaker Kurt Orderson is ready to be showcased to the community. The documentary chronicles the intergenerational experiences of spatial violence and its correlation to apartheid spatial planning and its modern incarnation, gentrification. Shot across three continents, in New York, SÃ£o Paulo and Cape Town the film is our response to witnessing how global capital continues its colonizing mission, decimating the lives and living places of ordinary citizens. The filmmakers felt that it is important to show the film to the community before it goes onto the international festival circuit, in solidarity with the legal cases on displacement currently unfolding in Cape Town and out of respect to the people and spaces that inspired this story. Cornerstone Institute is honoured to be hosting the second community screening on the 9th of March 2018 at 18h00.
