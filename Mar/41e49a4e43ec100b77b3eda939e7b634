Kinshasa â€” THE United Nations (UN) is demanding justice for its two human rights investigators killed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) a year ago. Experts Zaida Catalan (female, aged 36) and Michael Sharp (male, 34) were killed while investigating atrocities in the Kasai region. The Swedish and American nationals, respectively, were abducted along with four Congolese colleagues and found murdered two weeks after their disappearance. The Congolese remain unaccounted for. It is widely accepted the experts were killed by Kamwina Nsapu militia but government involvement has not been ruled out. Leila Zerrougui, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General, led staff as they paid tribute to the slain experts and all Congolese who lost their lives during the past year. "We continue to work to shed light on these heinous crimes and we want justice done for our experts and their Congolese escorts," Zerrougui said. In December, the military arrested a suspect for the alleged killing of the experts. Named as Constantin Tshidime Bulabula, he is suspected to be a member of amilitia that took up arms against government when sect leader, Nsapu, was killed by security forces in 2016. The crisis has spiraled resulting in the death of over 5 000 people. The crisis in Kasai is among numerous conflicts in the DRC after President Joseph Kabila maintained power despite the expiry of his term in 2016. DRC's human rights situation, which has displaced more than 4,5 million people, will be discussed next Tuesday at the 37th session of the Human Rights Council.
