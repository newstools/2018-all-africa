Tiger Brands, the company at the centre of the listeriosis outbreak, has had its subsidiary Enterprise, withdraw its viennas, sausages and polony from shop shelves after health inspectors found it to contain traces of listeriosis. Tiger Brands is still adamant that they will conduct their own scientific tests. 180 people have died as a result of the epidemic thus far.
