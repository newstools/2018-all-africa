It was on Thursday evening when the Nation arrived at Heathrow Airport, Terminal 2, to cover the arrival of Dr Miguna Miguna who was scheduled to land in the UK. All was well until the plane carrying the self-declared National Resistance Movement (NRM) general touched down from Germany with other passengers. NRM TOUR All travellers destined for the Queen's land but Dr Miguna made their way out of the airport. Moments later, the fiery lawyer, in a WhatsApp message, informed his hosts waiting outside the airport that he had been flagged down by the UK border control officials and police. His clearance, he said, was to be delayed if at all he would be let to proceed. The wait lasted around three hours from the time he arrived at the airport. He was later let into the country and allowed to proceed with the NRM tour in Oxford and London. Unknown to the hosts, Dr Miguna had been detained. TERROR ACT He was locked up under Schedule 7 of UK's Terrorism Act 2000, which is reserved for Special Branch officers. The law gives the police powers to examine persons of interest who pass through the UK borders. Narrating his ordeal, Dr Miguna told audience at the University of Oxford that Britain is the "beast of colonialism" and it continues to regard Kenya as its colony. He went on to accuse the host nation of orchestrating the recent political instability in Kenya for self-gain, citing Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that has claimed to have influenced President Kenyatta's win, as a product of UK's wide scheme. The barrister, who practises in Canada, accused senior figures in the Jubilee administration for his woes, claiming they made calls to the "higher-ups" in the UK to frustrate him. Dr Miguna is expected to land in Nairobi on Monday evening.
