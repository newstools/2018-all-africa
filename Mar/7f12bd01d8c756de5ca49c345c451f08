An iconic Nigerian portrait by artist Ben Enwonwu has sold for about U.S.$1.7 million - four times the highest estimate and a record for the artist's work. Enwonwu's 1974 painting of the Ife princess Adetutu Ademiluyi, known as Tutu, became a symbol of reconciliation after Nigeria's Biafra conflict.
