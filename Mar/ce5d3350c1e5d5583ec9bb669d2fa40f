"An Act of the Community takes precedent over similar legislations in the partner states", he said, adding that todate Eala has passed 79 pieces of legislation. Mr Ngoga, a law maker from Rwanda, reaffirmed Eala's readiness to work closely with the National Assemblies of the six EAC partner states. "This is not just an obligation but a concomitant desire by the Assembly to ensure citizens fully embrace the economic bloc", he remarked.

In addition, deeper and more frequent consultation with respective partner states's Parliamentary Committees would cement the integration process. The leader of the 10 person Ugandan delegation Hood Katuramu termed peace and security as important pillars necessary for regional integration.
