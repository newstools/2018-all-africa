At least three people are reported to have been killed and 4 others wounded in heavy clashes between Somali government forces and Al Shabaab militants in southern Somalia. The fighting broke out on the outskirts of Goofgaduud village, located about 35Km north of Baidoa city after Somali troops backed by Ethiopian soldiers attacked Al-Shabab customs base. The warring sides exchanged heavy and small weaponry during the combat that left 3 people from both sides dead and wounded four others, according to the local residents. The situation has returned to normal following the gunfight with reports that the allied forces have managed to flush out the militants from the area. The officials of Southwest state are yet to comment on the offensive against the Al Shabaab camp near Baidoa, a strategic city, some 250Km northwest of Mogadishu.
