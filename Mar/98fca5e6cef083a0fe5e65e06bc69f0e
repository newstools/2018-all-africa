The recent Ethiopia's signatory to African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA) is timely as the country soaring towards industrialization and diversification of its products, Trade Minister Dr Bekele Bulado said. In his briefing to local journalist about the beneficial prospects of the African Continental Free Trade Area to Ethiopia today, the Minister said it will increase flow of investment and provides better quality and price alternatives for the consumer. "The signed agreement has no harm for Ethiopia because it is signed among countries of equitable economic growth which is based on reciprocity," the Minister added. Ethiopia importing only 4 percent from Africa is not doing business as other African countries; Dr Bekele said and added that Ethiopia need to focus on key points such as quality and price of its products to maintain competence with a minimized production cost. "Countries that are well prepared with all the vital requirements will certainly benefit from the Continental Free Trade" he said. According to him, Ethiopia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Madagascar, Sudan and Djibouti have registered reservation on removing tariffs on 90 percent of goods of the agreement to be 85 and 10 percent "sensitive items". Ethiopia has signed 4 documents of the agreement including the framework, free goods and services trade, and dispute settlement rules and procedures and will continue to negotiate on the second phase that includes intellectual property rights and competition policy. The House of People's Representatives (HPR) is expected to thoroughly discuss on the matter and approve it, it was learned. It is to be recalled that after years of negotiation Ethiopia and 43 other African countries have signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement in Kigali, Rwanda on March 21, 2018. Ten of the 55 member African countries, including Nigeria, did not sign the agreement.
