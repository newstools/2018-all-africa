Efforts to safeguard heritages in various parts of nation are going well and bearing fruits said Research and Conservation Cultural Heritage Authority. Authority's International and Public Relation Office Head Fanta Beyene told The Ethiopian Herald that various projects have been carried out to renovate and restore the historical sites. Among the sites that are going to be renovated and restored, the Lalibela, Fasil, Tiya, and Axum heritages are the main ones. According to him, the Authority, which is mandated to protect, conserve and conduct researches, is implementing series of activities. "We are doing know with stockholders," he said. These heritages have strong ties with the respective societies and are the reflection of their identity. Due to this and their economic values, communities should be alert to protect and handover them to the next generation, Fanta said. Heritages like Lallibela Rock Hewn churches, the Fasill Compound and the Oblisks of Axum are attracting different tourists from across the world. Hence to register heritages both at the national and international level and attract more tourists, concerted efforts should be exerted, the Head said. However, in most cases, these historic heritage are exposed to various man made and natural threats. To end up this, the Authority is conducting research to identify the level of damage, and maintains the heritages with their rewarding values. Mentioning the problems in relation to lack of skilled man power, material, and budget, Fanta said the Authority is working with partners to maintain heritages.
