Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie has told a British parliamentary committee that his predecessor, Dan Muresan who died in a Kenyan hotel room in 2012, may have been poisoned. The British data mining firm admitted that it engineered a digital campaign that painted President Uhuru Kenyatta in a positive light, while smearing his main rival Raila Odinga during the 2013 and 2017 election period. The firm also admitted to working on election campaigns for other African leaders.
