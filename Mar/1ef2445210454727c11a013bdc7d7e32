A government minister has said Zimbabwean products and services are the most expensive in the region, largely due to high production costs caused by the cost of key utilities. Deputy Finance Minister, Terrence Mukupe, said electricity and water tariffs were unsustainable. Electricity tariffs in Zimbabwe are pegged at 9,86 cents per KWh, whereas in Zambia and Ethiopia, for example, power tariffs are pegged at five cents per kWh and six cents per kWh respectively.
