Be advised that fast moving water is extremely dangerous," read the warning from the weatherman. This came after the director of Meteorological Services Peter Ambenje issued a heavy rain advisory on many parts of the country between Monday and March 16. THE COUNTIES The counties expected to receive heavy rains are Kisii, Kericho, Bomet, Narok, Migori, Kakamega, Kajiado, Nakuru, Kwale, Marsabit, Isiolo, Turkana, Samburu, Nairobi, Nyeri, Kiambu, Murang'a, Kitui, Machakos, Makueni, Kilifi, Mombasa, Lamu and Taita-Taveta. "Heavy rainfall of more than 40mm in 24 hours is likely to be experienced in western Kenya, south and central Rift Valley and central Kenya," Mr Ambenje added. LOWLANDS South Rift Valley, southern lowlands, northern and central parts of Kenya are likely to be hit by heavy rains on Wednesday. The situation will be replicated in Western, Coast, the North, Rift Valley, Central and southern lowlands on Thursday and Friday. STALLING The department told motorists not to drive on flooded sections of the road. "Six inches of water will reach the bottom of most passenger cars, causing loss of control and potential stalling. Drive slowly," the advisory went on. Nairobi residents were also asked to get weather updates from the media.
