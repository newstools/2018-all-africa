When the national science academies of the EU member states issue a report, one might think it would be hard to dispute. But any amateur can poke big holes in the report, suggesting that the purpose is alarmist climate propaganda, rather than an honest assessment of extreme weather risks. Last week, the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC), comprising representatives of the 27 national science academies of member states, presented new data in an update to a report on extreme weather first compiled in 2013.
