A fire broke out at Kuriftu Resort and Spa, Adama, on March 12, 2018, caused by fire sparks from the transformer burning 24 out of 92 room of the resort. Both the owner of the resort, Tadios Getachew, and Mayor of Adama City, Adanech Abiebie, confirmed that an electric line shock caused the fire accident that damaged the Resort. The fire continued to burn for almost two hours before it was extinguished by the joint effort of the city's fire-rescue brigade and the residents of the city. "We are waiting for the results of a forensic investigation to confirm the cause scientifically," said Lemma Haile, security head of the city administration. The resort has resumed operations with the remaining facilities, according to Tadios.
