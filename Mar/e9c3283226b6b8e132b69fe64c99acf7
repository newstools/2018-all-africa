In turn, the Secretary of State for National Defence, Gaspar Rufino, described the date as an event that marked the final victory of the Angolan people, who fought for several centuries for their sovereignty and independence.

It engaged the Cuban-backed People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) on one side, and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) with help of the South African Defence Force (SADF) on the other side.
