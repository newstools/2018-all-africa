The venue was the Crazy Altanta Travel restaurant and bar in Downtown Atlanta, US and the event was Spring Break in Atlanta, on March 17. The musical event brought together a slew of US-based Rwandan hip-hop artistes, under the label, The Creative Genius (Jay Pac, Mr. Rock, Young P, and Boris), the event organisers. These were joined by Kigali-based Rwandan DJ Africano of PromoAfrika communications, who had camped in Atlanta from March 11, ahead of the event. To show some love to their own, many Rwandan music lovers travelled from various states, like Michigan, Miami, Chicago, Ohio, Maine, North Carolina and Washington DC to be part of the event. It was the second time DJ Africano was DJ-ing in the US. The first time was in April 2016. Africano took to the DJs booth shortly after 10p.m, taking revelers on a musical journey that blended Rwandan and other musical sounds from around the world. Just before midnight, rappers from The Creative Genius took to the stage, belting out some of their favourite hits like African Boy, Tutaranywa, getting the predominantly Rwandan audience of revelers onto their feet. The group performed till after 1a.m when the Crazy Atlanta resident DJs, 5 Star and Teflon Don, joined forces to deliver back-to-back music mixes till 3a.m when curtains fell on the show.
