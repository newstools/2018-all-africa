Tonight’s Live Show was off the charts, from the mind-blowing performances to the shocking twists, we were all kept at the edge of our seats. After all was said and done, the Housemates all went into the Arena where they awaited Big Brother himself. The Light Show Meeting Biggie was a momentous occasion and it definitely looked the part. The lighting was dramatic, the ninja’s all stood around Biggie’s chair, embodying a King’s court and the Housemates had to line up in front of this exhibit like subjects. It was a sight to behold and truly set the tone for the series of events that unfolded thereafter Speechless Maybe it was the grandiose exhibition of Biggie’s power or just the mere idea that they were going to meet him for the first time but the Housemates looked shook. When Biggie initially asked if anyone had questions, they all remained mum and said nothing. After this Biggie addressed each of them individually and their responses were extremely meek and soft. Very paradoxical seeing as though most of the Housemates are larger than life when they are living it up in the House. Generosity Biggie was in an exponentially generous mood tonight, first he told the Housemates there would be no Evictions, and he then threw a spanner in the works and gave them a choice stating that they can leave the game now and choose an envelope with an undisclosed sum of money in it. While there were signs of temptation from Rico Swavey and Alex, no one took the bait at the end of the day. Just to sweeten the deal even more, Biggie also removed everyone’s strikes which caused Tobi, Lolu and Cee-C to brim with joy. Reset All of this was a symbolic moment in order for Biggie to reset the game in order for things to move forward in a new light. It is going to be a whole new game with Anto and Khloe coming back. This is going to shift the vibe in the House and definitely spice things up. What did you think of tonight’s events?
