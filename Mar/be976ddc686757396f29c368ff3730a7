President Emmerson Mnangagwa has extended the 3 month ultimatum he had given to those who had illegally taken foreign currency out of the country to return it. This comes amid indications that of the 1 166 cases, involving U.S.$1.3 billion, only U.S.$250 million has been retrieved. The original amnesty expired on February 28, but has since been extended by another 2 weeks, with Mnangagwa saying he will then name and shame the suspects.
