Johannesburg â€” THE first car to be driven by an artificial intelligence- (AI-) powered smartphone has been unveiled. It is the brainchild of Huawei, the global technology leader. Officials believe the 'RoadReader' project pushes the boundaries of Huawei's object recognition technology and puts the learning capabilities, speed and performance of its AI-powered devices to the test. Huawei has transformed a Porsche Panamera into a driverless vehicle that doesn't just see, but crucially, understands its surroundings. This means that it can distinguish between thousands of different objects including a cat and a dog, a ball or a bike and learn to take the most appropriate course of action. Huawei's 'Road Reader' project is taking advantage of the AI capabilities already in the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. The device uses AI to automatically recognise objects like cats, dogs, food, and other objects, to help people take pictures like a pro. Our smartphone is already outstanding at object recognition. We wanted to see if in a short space of time we could teach it to not only drive a car, but to use its AI capabilities to see certain objects, and be taught to avoid them," says Andrew Garrihy, Chief Marketing Officer, Huawei Western Europe. "If our technology is intelligent enough to achieve this in just five weeks - what else can it make possible?" Huawei is showcasing the Road Reader project and the vehicle's capabilities at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
