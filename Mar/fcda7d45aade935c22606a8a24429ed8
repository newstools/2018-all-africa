The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) yesterday airlifted personnel of the Nigerian Army and Nigerian Navy to the Gambia as part of the ongoing ECOWAS Mission in Gambia (ECOMIG). The troops were airlifted by the NAF C-130 Hercules Aircraft included officers, soldiers and ratings from 351 Artillery Regiment as well as from the Special Boat Services of the Navy. A statement by the Director of Public Relations and Information of the Nigerian Air Force, Air Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya said the troops and other equipment deployed for the operation were airlifted from the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport Abuja to Banjul in The Gambia. Adesanya said aircraft was expected to return the Nigerian contingent that had completed 6 months tour of duty in The Gambia as stipulated for troop's rotation in the ECOMIG Operation. It would be recalled that the NAF was the first to deploy to The Gambia in January 2017 as part of the standby force tasked by ECOWAS Heads of State to enforce the December 1, 2016 election mandate, which installed Adama Barrow as President.
