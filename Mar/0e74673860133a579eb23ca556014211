First established in Bulawayo last year, Red Cafe took no time to become a venue of choice for many out-goers in the city of kings prompting the owners to take their brand another fine journey into the capital city of Harare. Red Cafe officially opened door to Harare patrons last week Friday with the launch well attended. A visit to the new joint, one could mistake it for place outside Harare due to the red color painting and outstanding faces of attendants who serve customers. The environment is serene, something that gives patrons a refreshing feel considering that Harare CBD is now arguably one of the noisiest places due to human activity. This according to the owners should give Red Cafe customers a reason to want to hangout at the joint which they say is the first of its kind in Harare. Club manager, Johannes Chipoyera told 263Chat that the numbers of people who have visited the new spot since it opened doors last week has given them a reason to smile as it is promising. "The Harare club is getting much love from different types of people because of its new outing style and it is promising to be the next hot place in town. "We will try to do best for our customers so that they can have a good experience. We are going to be hosting a new style of entertainment," said Chipoyera At the official opening night, the young and fast rising Afro Jazz artist, Gary Tight gave an outstanding acoustic performance with the peoples' choice Disc Jockey Dj Iroq pulling out one of his best performances on the night. The caf√© is divided into 4 compartments with one for meetings, the other for food listening to soft vibes and the other two being dance flows with bar sections.
