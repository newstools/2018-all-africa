Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy on March 21, 2018 spent his second night in police custody after being picked up a day earlier for questioning over allegations that he received campaign funding from the late Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. Police are investigating alleged irregularities over the financing of Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign. French-Lebanese businessman, Ziad Takieddine in November 2016 told the French news website Mediapart that between 2006 and 2007, he handed over three suitcases stuffed with 200 and 500 Euro bank notes to Sarkozy and Claude Gu√©ant, his Chief of Staff. Police have questioned Sarkozy before, but denied any wrongdoing.
