Bongo flava star Diamond Platinumz's troubles seem to be getting worse. Just days after being dumped by his longtime partner Zari Hassan over continuous infidelity, two of his hit singles have now been banned in Tanzania. On Wednesday Tanzania Communication Authority (TCRA) published a list of 15 songs that have been blacklisted for airplay on any media station in country for not meeting the moral threshold required for public consumption. Among the 15 songs are Diamond's hits Waka Waka featuring American rapper Rick Ross and Hallelujah featuring the legendary reggae Jamaican group Morgan Heritage. The two songs released last year have over 5 million views on YouTube Waka Waka with 5.8 million while Hallelujah has over 8.7 million views. TCRA has taken action to ban the songs after president John Magufuli lamented the proliferation of numerous ratchet videos on Tanzania TV stations.
