Maputo — Representatives of the Mozambican and British governments met in Maputo on Friday to discuss new models of school bathrooms that will improve access for disabled children and will help girl students and women teachers manage their menstrual periods. The national director of school health in the Ministry of Education, Arlinda Chaquisse, said this project will be of great help for pupils in urban schools, where there are cases of girls dropping out of school because of the embarrassment they feel during their periods. “Various schools don't have good sanitary conditions, and when the girls begin their periods, they clearly feel uncomfortable”, said Chaquisse. She hoped that the sanitary condition of schools will improve with the new models of bathrooms, creating more comfort and convenience for girls. The head of the technical assistance department in the National Directorate of Water Supply and Sanitation, Julieta Paulo, said that, in an initial phase, the improved sanitary systems will be built in schools in the central province of Zambezia. She said she hoped that this project will result in reducing the level of absenteeism among girl students. The new bathrooms were designed by a team of experts in “inclusive school equipment” and in gender issues, based on past experiences undertaken by various partners of the government. The project is financed by the British Department for International Development (DFID), but Julieta Paulo could not say how much money DFID is investing.
