(sic)" She added: "This is it bub; our dream ie growing old together is coming true, slowly but surely. You are a blessing in God's Kingdom, a true Gentleman, a (closet) stand-up comedian, a wealth of knowledge and wisdom, a philanthropist, a talented artist, a born entertainer, a phenomenal provider, a silly playful but crazily respected Super-Dad, and mostly, a man of honour. Thank you for choosing me.(sic)" The couple first met at drama school in 1998 and later starred alongside each other in the Afrikaans soapie, 7de Laan . Christi and Nico share two children together, Eva and Shay. Source: The Juice
