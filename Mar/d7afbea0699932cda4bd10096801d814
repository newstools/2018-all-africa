The National Education Health & Allied Workers Union [NEHAWU] supports the 14th Annual International Israel Apartheid Week which will run from today Monday March 12 to Sunday March 17, 2018. The national union believes all progressive South Africans should deepen one of the most important pillars of our struggle - international solidarity, using our defeat of apartheid and our lived experiences of racial segregation and oppression to intensify solidarity with the colonised and oppressed people of Palestine. As NEHAWU, we call on all peace loving people from across the world to intensify steps towards a complete boycott and international sanctions to isolate apartheid Israel. Furthermore, we commit ourselves to fighting for the total emancipation of the Palestinian people and pledge to redouble our efforts to ensure that Palestine is freed from apartheid Israel oppression. We are more than convinced that our efforts will form part of the building blocks of international solidarity that will allow for a movement towards freedom. The national union continues to reject the announcement by US President Donald Trump of East Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel and the transferring of his embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. As NEHAWU, we continue to recognise Jerusalem as the capital city of Palestine that is currently occupied by Apartheid Israel. We reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional support for the total shutdown of the South African Embassy in Tel-Aviv. We also call on all our members and workers, who themselves are beneficiaries of an international solidarity struggle to support and advance this position, that enjoys the support of majority of provinces of the ANC. Our members in all nine Provinces will be participating in activities organised by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement [BDS] and other fraternal organisations.
