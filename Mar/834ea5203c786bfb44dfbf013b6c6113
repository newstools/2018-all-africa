Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Studies in partnership with Steffen Helbing, a German politician is set to launch an emergency call application for different distress situations. Stephen Helbing who facilitated the application made this known at an event in Abuja said the device is called "HandHelp", and that "the application is important to women and children in cases of kidnapping and other incidences". Also speaking, Executive Director Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Studies Dr. Aminu Zakari, said that there was a ten year strategic plan with Steffen Helbing to facilitate the launch of the app. "These plans are developmental plans for the disabled community and to develop sustainable agricultural projects for the disabled. The HandHelp application can be found on apple store and also on google play, adding that there is also an NGO initiative that Steffen Helbing intends to do for the disabled," Dr. Zakari also said that the application which is security sensitive is not only meant for the disabled but for also able people which can be used in emergency situations such as kidnapping, robbery, accident, fire outbreak and also sickness. He added that the centre is in talks with the security agencies on how to make the application better accessible to the general public, adding that the application also comes with a button that can be used in distress situations of which the first month of use comes with a free trial while the monthly cost of the application is N400.
