The Kenya Forest Service (KFS) is facing an acute shortage of rangers to enforce the ban on logging, an official has said. Deputy Chief Conservator of Forests Patrick Kariuki on Wednesday disclosed that the agency has 2,500 rangers and 4,800 staff, who are inadequate to safeguard the country's forest cover. The revelation came at a time when saw millers petitioned the government to lift the ban, saying it is hurting the building and construction industry. FOREST COVERSpeaking during a tree planting session in Timboroa Forest, Uasin Gishu County, Mr Kariuki said they need at least 4,500 rangers to effectively cover the forests and other water catchment areas. "We are experiencing a national problem in terms of staffing to protect our forests, and it is our appeal to Kenyans to participate in environmental conservation efforts," he said. He said the agency is reaching out to Community Forest Association, saw millers and farmers to invest in commercial farm forestry in order to increase forest cover from 7.2 per cent to 10 per cent. Mr Kariuki said trees will be planted on 10 hectares of public forest land this year, while farmers will commit 21 hectares. CLIMATE CHANGE Mr William Kiprono, the Secretary of Administration in the Environment ministry, said climate change and ballooning population are some of the leading causes of deforestation. Mr Kiprono asked saw millers to await a report on forest conservation before the three months' ban is lifted. He said KFS plans to plant 500 million trees by 2022.
