Artala â€” The Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) has strongly condemned attacks by Sudanese government forces on the inhabitants of Artala village in Central Darfur. A statement issued by the Revolutionary Front said that the tribal militias of the government and its security services gathered the residents of the village in a humiliating manner after they were confirmed to be free of weapons, beat them with whips and seized their property. Mohamed Zakariya, the spokesman for the SRF, described what happened to the residents of the village as "a shameful state crime against unarmed people and a blatant violation of the rights of citizenship". In its statement, the SRF also condemned the ongoing crackdown on freedoms and the arrest of activists by the security services and reiterated its call for the immediate and unconditional release of all the political detainees and the prisoners of war. A video widely circulated via by social media (see above) this week shows government forces beating and harassing dozens of men of the village. It has drawn widespread condemnation among activists and human rights defenders demanding the government authorities to form a committee of inquiry into the incident described as shameful.
