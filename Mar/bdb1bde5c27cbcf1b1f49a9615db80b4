Big Brother Africa fans may be excited to know that Channel Yedu, a local production company, is launching a local version of the show which will be called Big Sister. The show will have the same rules as Big Brother Africa but some terms and conditions will be suited to meet the Zimbabwean market. Big Sister is expected to kick off in June and end mid-July with 30 housemates battling for a cash prize of about U.S.$25,000.
