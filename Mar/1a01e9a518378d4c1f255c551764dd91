The security forces of Somalia's northeastern semi-autonomous region of Puntland have carried out a massive operation in parts of the port city of Bosaso on Monday night. The sweep came following series of insecurity acts and assassinations targeting security force members and civil servants in the town over the past few weeks Puntland officials said the state troop's agents had conducted a house-to-house operation in parts of the restive Bosaso where they detained several suspects in the night-long swoop. Those arrested on the Sunday night crackdown are being interrogated by the security forces. The authorities promised to release suspects found not guilty. On Monday, suspected Al Shabaab assailants have shot and killed a top Puntland Intelligence officer whose name has been identified only as Shine, according to the local authorities.
