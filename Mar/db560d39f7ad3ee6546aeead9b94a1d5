The new hypermarket brings to five the number of the French retail chain's branch network in the country. Uchumi Supermarkets announced it's closure of the Sarit Centre Mall store, which had operated for over three decades, saying it will now look for an alternative space that is "cost-effective" and aligned to "changing trends" in the sector following months of closing non-performing brances across the country.
