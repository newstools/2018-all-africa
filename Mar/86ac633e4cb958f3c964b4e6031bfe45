The director-general, Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), Prof. Sani Mashi has said the federal government loses over a billion naira due to neglect of Meteorological information by several government agencies. Prof. Mashi disclosed this at the weekend while briefing journalists on an occasion to commemorate the 2018 World Meteorological Day with the theme "Weather Ready, Climate Smart." He explained that with over 12,000 ships coming in and out of Nigeria annually, the government would be making over one billion naira if the maritime agencies subscribe to NiMet meteorological information. He further noted that in order to achieve this target, the National Assembly and the government should make enabling laws and policies that would compel all agencies to subscribe to NiMet's Meteorological information. Mashi said 30 per cent of agricultural yields could be achieved if relevant meteorological information was utilised. He also said that 2017 is the warmest year without El Nino and one of the three warmest years on record adding that the long-term climate change as a result of greenhouse gas emissions had committed the earth planet to a warmer future, with more extreme weather and water shocks. He added that global leaders had raised concerns about extreme weather, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, major natural disasters, man-made environmental disasters, failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation in Global Risk Report. According to him, extreme weather events are seen as single most prominent risk. He noted that "against the foregoing, NiMet embarked on regular weather and climate predictions to help the public to mitigate the effects of extreme weather events through Early Warning Systems (EWSs)."
