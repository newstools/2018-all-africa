Nairobi â€” THE Al-Shabaab terror group has killed four Kenyan police officers and a reservist on the border with Somalia. Officials reported the bloodshed in the northeastern Mandera County was a revenge attack after the security forces killed 40 al Shabaab militants, including two senior commanders, last Tuesday. Joint operations by the Kenya Defense Forces and African Union (AU) Mission killed the Muslim radicals. Regional county commissioner, Mohamud Saleh, said the Al-Shabaab was on a revenge mission following the heavy casualties they suffered in the hands of the troops. "We are pursuing the militants, some of whom sustained injuries following the heavy exchange of gun fire," Saleh said. "The militants do not deserve free publicity because that is what they yearn." The extremists attacked two police camps in before retreating to Somalia. Kenya is enduring sporadic attacks by the Somali-based terror group Al-Shabaab. This is in retaliation to the presence of Kenyan troops that are part of the AU mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which consists of over 20 000 soldiers. AMISOM was deployed in 2007 with the approval of the United Nations. As part of its duties, AMISOM also supports the Federal Government of Somalia's forces in their battle against Al-Shabaab militants.
