Lovers of fashion will find this weekend's edition of CNN African Voices a delight to watch as the Globacom-sponsored programme focuses on women across Africa who are driving the styles found on runways around the world. According to Globacom, those billed to showcase the contributions of Africa's female fashionistas to the global fashion industry on the programme are Ethiopia's Anna Getaneh, Nafisa Hafiz of Sudan and Anita Beryl from Uganda. Getaneh is a former international model, a humanitarian and social entrepreneur. She is also the founder and Creative Director of African Mosaique, a clothing design, manufacturing and retail company in Johannesburg, South Africa. She is expected to dwell on how she is using fashion to empower and connect African designers. For Sudan's Nafisa Hafiz, her dreams of leading her country's fashion industry begin with drawing inspiration from traditional designs. On the programme, the designer will let viewers into her fashion world and how successful she has been in realising her dreams. The third guest on the programme, Anita Beryl, is described by CNN as 'a thriving entrepreneur who is making her name known in Kampala through her fashion house". She is the creative director of award-winning Beryl Qouture, a Ugandan fashion industry power house. Just last year, she was invited to showcase her designs at the World Fashion Week 2017, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
