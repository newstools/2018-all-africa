St. Peter's Specialized Hospital disclosed that it has been actively conducting studies on improving TB treatment. The studies mainly focus on identifying mechanisms that reduce the impact of the disease and shorten the period of such treatment, Hospital CEO Yakob Seman told The Ethiopian Herald. The first study which was conducted on Multi-Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has entered into its second phase called a clinical trial, he said. The major objective of the study is to shortening the two year long treatments to cure MDR-TB. "The study would help to reduce patient's pain on MDR-TB treatment as the healing process causes physical and psychological injuries." The study would help to produce drug that would cure the MDR -TB patients within less than one year period, he stated. St. Peter's three trial physicians and four nurses have been actively engaging in such study and its outcome will be publicized within two years, he noted. The study is being taken place in five countries across the world monitored by the World Health Organization, said Yakob adding, the national TB program is also working with the hospital for the better accomplishment. The research might elongate with additional phases, if clinical trial brings notable result. The second research on TB is a Stigma Study which will be publicized three months later. The study could help to identify the stigma impact on medicating the disease, according to the CEO. The research is also intended to identify which social group has a wide exposure to the disease and point out possible protection mechanisms, he expressed. The undergoing study is proceeding by identifying the people in three categories including normal, congregate and working groups, he underlined. The studies are believed to be supportive components to design national health policy, Yakob disclosed.
