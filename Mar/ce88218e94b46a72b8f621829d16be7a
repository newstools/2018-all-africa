ORANGE, the telecommunications operator, aims to become a key player in energy transition in Africa. The French-firm has extended its services to five new countries in the continent- Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali and Senegal. At the Africa Chief Executive (CEOs) Officers Forum, held in Abidjan, the Ivoirian capital city, Orange confirmed its desire to become a key player in the energy transition sector in Africa by providing services directly to the general public or as a wholesaler to public operators. Orange already provides a service offering rural populations access to solar energy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Madagascar. "Orange wants to be much more than a telecoms operator in Africa," Bruno Mettling, Chief Executive Officer of Orange Middle East and Africa, said. He said the company wanted to be a provider of essential services for its customers, hence the development solutions allowing as many people as possible to access everyday essentials such as sustainable energy is a strong message in this direction. "We think first and foremost of children who will be able to do their homework in the evening, but also of professionals who will gain in efficiency thanks to more readily available energy," Mettling said. Orange is present in 20 countries in Africa and the Middle East. It has more than 130 million customers.
