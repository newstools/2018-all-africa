Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has told MPs that former ministers of his portfolio should also go to Parliament to account for the early naturalisation of the Guptas.This comes as the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs agreed to finally hold a full inquiry into the process that led to members of the Gupta family receiving their documents. The embattled Gupta family faces scrutiny over their alleged influence over former president Jacob Zuma and other government officials, which was noted by former public protector Thuli Madonesla in her "State of Capture" report.
