The Ethiopian Tourism Organization said protecting peace and tourism should be a priority agenda to all citizens and stakeholders engaged in the sector. A three days training targeting stake holders, like hotels and tour operators, was launched here yesterday. Briefing journalists Assistant Professor Yechale Mihiret, Deputy Director at the Organization said the training is aimed at upgrading the awareness of these groups on how to protect tourism destination from terrorist attacks. He also stressed that the integrated effort of stake holders would play crucial role in sustaining peace and preserving tourism. Assistant commissioner of the Federal Police Commission Muluwork Gebre, who offered the training, told the trainees that terrorism has been targeting infrastructure during early trends. Now commercial centers and Tourist destinations around the globe have become major targets. He said research conducted in 2014 indicated that 23 percent of terrorist attacks were on commercial centers while tourist destinations follow by 20 percent. The commissioner also noted that terrorist attacks of Alshabab and Bokoharam have been threatening the horn region and west Africa respectively due to the complex maneuvers and networks that the groups utilize. According to the research presented for the trainees, Kenya has suffered about 28 terrorist attacks. Meanwhile, due to the integrated efforts of the government and its public, Ethiopia has managed to prevent terrorist attacks and none is registered. "But it does not mean that there have never been attempts from terrorist groups to attack the country. It is just a fact that Ethiopia has a long time specialized experience in preventing terrorism," he added. It was learnt from the training that terrorism has different definitions in different countries based on their own realities and is estimated to reach 197. Somehow, Yechale underlined that no matter the definitions, terrorists have no other political agenda or concern.
