Khartoum â€” AN outbreak of meningitis has left more than 30 people dead in the war-torn South Sudan. More than 170 cases of the disease have been reported in the eastern Equatoria State's Torit, Iyire and Imurok regions. The medical condition, which is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, is the latest in a series of epidemics in the world's newest country. A Rift Valley fever outbreak has been reported in the central Yirol region with 40 human cases. There have been at least nine confirmed cases affecting cattle. Meanwhile, the northern-western Aweil State is experiencing an outbreak of measles. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and government are planning a reactive measles campaign targeting children aged 6 months to 59 months. The campaign is slated for later this week. The East African country, which gained independence from Sudan in 2011, is beset by a civil war that has been raging since 2013 after a power struggle broke out between President Salva Kiir and his then deputy Riek Machar. About 3 million people - a quarter of the population - have been displaced. Of these, 1 million have fled to neighbouring countries.
