Zambian officials deported controversial dancer Zodwa Wabantu, who is popularly known for her sultry dance moves and performing without underwear, on the grounds that her performance would "undermine national values". She was billed to perform on Saturday in Lusaka at the launch of a music album organised by a local entertainment company, Sunset Sound Production.
