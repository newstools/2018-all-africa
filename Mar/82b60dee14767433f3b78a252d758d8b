Ado Ekiti â€” Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State yesterday alleged that the willingness by the Federal Government to negotiate and pay ransom indicates that the defeat of insurgency may not come any time soon. According to him, the menace was being promoted by influential citizens who are making fortunes at the expense of the masses.He called on the international community to intervene by looking deeper into the killings of innocent people by the insurgents, adding it should initiate a fact-finding mission. Addressing newsmen in Ado-Ekiti on the resurgence of terrorism, Fayose noted: "We don't have external aggression, what we have is an internal aggression. We are calling on the international community to look beyond Boko Haram or herdsmen and probe into those behind the insurgents. Nigerians are becoming helpless. "Benue people need international intervention, they need support. We want to believe that the President has lost the battle. His approach has been cosmetic."That was why we kicked against the move to take $1billion from the Excess Crude Account. When we continue to pay ransom, we won't get anywhere. We are paying $2 million to somebody. So, what is the essence of the fight by the Nigerian army?" He went on: "How would you want us to believe that the Nigerian army cannot engage herdsmen and Boko Haram? It seems that the reason for the coming of President Muhammadu Buhari to secure Nigeria has been defeated in all areas. " Nigerians are angry and hungry on a daily basis. I can't understand why the Federal Government cannot take a stand to engage these so-called herdsmen. They flaunt their weapons on the social media and the government looks the other way. Currently, the APC government is paying a lip service to the challenge of insecurity." The governor urged Nigerians to challenge the President to act decisively.
