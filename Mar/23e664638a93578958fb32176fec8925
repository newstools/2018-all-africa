Jebel Marra â€” Two people were wounded in an attack reportedly by paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on villagers in southern Jebel Marra on Saturday. Speaking to Radio Dabanga, listeners said that RSF troops riding in 25 Land Cruisers, backed by others on more than 70 camels and horses, shot a group of people on their way to the weekly market of Kara on Saturday afternoon. "When the janjaweed neared the market, they began shooting around them. Adam Waddoura and Amran Ahmed were seriously wounded by the bullets," a villager reported. "They then proceeded to the market, where they beat the people with their whips and sticks before they plundered the shops and robbed all the customers of their goods, money, mobile phones, and donkeys. They then left towards the area of Umelgura." The sources all said that the militiamen came from the area of Sina, where fighting erupted between government forces and combatants of the Sudan Liberation Movement led by Abdelwahid El Nur (SLM-AW) last week. Ezzeldin Sambala, the spokesman for the SLM-AW strongly condemned the attack. "This incident again confirms the extent of the involvement of the regime and its militias in brutal crimes against our defenceless people," he told this station. He claimed that the "many militiamen in the region are still fully armed", and called the disarmament campaign in Darfur "one big lie".
