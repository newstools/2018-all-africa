Nation Media Group notes with regret the position taken by columnists who have been writing for NMG platforms and have decided to stop writing for our publications. We respect their right to take a collective decision, although of them had an individual contract that we have diligently honoured over the years we have worked with them. We wish to reiterate that overall we have honoured our obligation to respect their views and did not tamper with their positions except to correct basic errors. NMG was founded more than a half a century ago on the bedrock of independent voices, diversity and freedom of expression. It is in this regard that we developed, through a process of public participation and published our editorial policy to guide our conduct and journalism. We believe that the principles of independence, fairness and balance, as espoused in our editorial policy, are key to promoting the democratic space while being mindful of the impact that information in the public space plays in shaping opinions. We wish to reassure our readers and stakeholders that we continue to be committed to media freedom whilst delivering value in line with expectations.
