GIFT BOXES Janet is three months pregnant and having three women in the household all pregnant at the same time, she had a lot to say. "You know, I'm super happy for them, but the timing. I don't even think I have started making arrangements because I'm in denial I'm like this is too much to handle. My day bug has been with me for a really long time and she is pretty much like family... my live in was also the first one we got when our son was born and she's so amazing with him," she said. In the video, Janet shared details of gift boxes that she will be gifting her house helps as they proceed on maternity leave. Janet also shared tips on how she keeps herself busy in the house, including trying out new recipes with a chef.
