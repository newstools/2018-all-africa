Maun â€” Assistant Minister for Presidential Affairs, Governance and Public Administration Mr Thato Kwerepe has commended Cresta Marakanelo Group for contributing to the transformation of Maun into a significant economic stature through their new addition, Cresta Maun Hotel. Speaking at the official opening of Cresta Maun on March 22, Mr Kwerepe said Botswana has been experiencing economic benefits of the hospitality industry in recent years. He noted that Cresta Maun Hotel, which was valued at about P70 million, had employed about 100 people, half of whom originate from Maun, which has helped curb unemployment in the area. Mr Kwerepe said the hotel facilities, which had 83 rooms that include a presidential suite, five junior suites, 77 standard rooms and two conference facilities with the capacity of about 230 people, was anticipated to attract more people to Maun. He noted that the hospitality business industry produced more results if it provided quality facilities such as hotels, lodges and camps to match the world class customers. The Cresta Marakanelo general manager, Mr Mokwena Morulane said the Cresta brand was the fastest growing hospitality business in Botswana, therefore he appreciated the support from the country's leaders. Mr Morulane noted that Cresta had 11 operational branches in Botswana, one in Zambia and was hopeful of further acquisitions in some parts of Africa. He noted that Cresta Maun had a unique outlook, which signified an African fingerprint gateway, which is for hotels that are unique in the Cresta family. "You would recognise that the prominent colour is brown and it represents the coffee coloured African landscape in the afternoon," he said. Cresta Maun, he said was inspired by the realisation that Maun as a tourism capital of Botswana and the gateway to the Okavango Delta had to offer the market a unique taste. Source : BOPA
