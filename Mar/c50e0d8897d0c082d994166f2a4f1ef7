A clip of young Nigerian girls dancing to DJ Spinall and Wizkid's new song, Nowo, went viral. It was shared by Rihanna, who used it to celebrate her Apple Music streaming milestone. The girls are part of a dance group called Dream Catchers, a team of underprivileged children whose welfareÂ  - from education to shelter - are taken care of by the group's founder, Seyi Oluyole. Seyi uses dance to encourage them to stay in school.
