Blogger Robert Alai has seemingly bagged a job at Governor Mike Sonko's City Hall following a brief Twitter chat over the weekend. Alai appeared to have nailed the job after offering himself to Sonko to enforce the building code and get rid of sub-standard buildings in the capital city This was in response to Sonko's tweets on rescue operations in Ruai after a four-storey building collapsed on Saturday morning. Alai replied to the governor: "Give me the job of enforcing building code. All sub-standard buildings will come down." Sonko quickly asked the blogger to contact him for a Monday meeting. Two other Nairobians offered their services to Alai, saying they would help in mobilization as well as execution of the building code. Some however protested the governor's invitation saying the job should be given to engineers and not bloggers. Give me the job of enforcing building code. All sub-standard buildings will come down. - Robert ALAI, HSC (@RobertAlai) March 17, 2018 Contact me for a meeting from Monday. -- Mike Sonko (@MikeSonko) March 17, 2018 Thanks. I will. -- Robert ALAI, HSC (@RobertAlai) March 17, 2018 Can i contact you after your meeting, i can be of great assistance in executing the code -- Kenji Kenji (@sirkenji) March 17, 2018 and i will contact you to immobilize the personnel to execute the code. -- DJ NICKSTYLES (@dj_nickstyles) March 17, 2018 Good jobs required professions with ethics to stand out. Standing out in social media profession does not qualify one to building & structural engineering. This invitation is like kawaida a good PR. Am treating this as just an invitation for tea with the Governor. Go enjoy! -- Hamid Sheikh (@hmdsheikh60) March 17, 2018 LMAO. I'm an Urban Planner and I'm laughing myself to tears. -- Bildad Kaggia. (@kenyanpeasant) March 17, 2018
