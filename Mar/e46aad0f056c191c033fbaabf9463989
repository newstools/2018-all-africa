Within four months of taking control of Angola, President Joao Lourenco sacked his predecessor's daughter as head of the state-run oil company and the son as head of the country's sovereign wealth fund. Now both Isabel dos Santos and Jos√© Filomeno dos Santos are at the centre of criminal investigations with him being charged with fraud relating to a U.S.$500 million transaction out of an account belonging to the central bank, and has been barred from leaving the country.
