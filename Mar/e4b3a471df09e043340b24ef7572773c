Six air force members based at the Namibia Defence Force base near Karibib were seriously injured yesterday when the vehicle they were travelling in crashed into a bridge. A police incident report issued yesterday indicated that the accident happened about five kilometres from Karibib towards Omaruru. A case of reckless, alternatively negligent driving, was opened. The accident happened around 01h30 when the driver allegedly lost control of the grey VW Golf, and the car left the road and hit a pillar of the bridge before it overturned. The injured members are Ruben Amateta (driver), Gebhard Oshondili Ambuga, Matias Nangombe, Juliano Basson, Salomo Silas (23) and Mennas Mulunga (24). They were all admitted to the Usakos State Hospital, but Amateta, Ambunga, Nangombe and Basson were later transferred to a Windhoek hospital.
