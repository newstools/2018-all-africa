Homa Bay County nurses have gone on strike to protest delayed payment of salaries. The more than 600 nurses claimed that more than 80 of their colleagues have not received their salaries from December 2017. Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) Homa Bay branch Secretary-General George Opiyo Bola said the health workers will not resume work until all their grievances are solved. "For instance, our February salary was given to us in March and at the moment we don't even know when we will receive this month's salary," Mr Bola said, adding that the Cyprian Awiti-led administration has not given reasons for the delay. County Health Executive Richard Muga said the matter is being looked into. "We are doing whatever [is] possible to ensure that we solve the payment crisis," Dr Muga said. SHORTAGE OF NURSES Mr Bola further decried acute shortage of nurses at the county's referral hospital. He said the hospital has 124 nurses instead of 400, which in turn compromises their productivity. The union also wants competent nurses promoted.
