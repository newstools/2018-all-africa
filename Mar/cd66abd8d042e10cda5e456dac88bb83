When local Afro-pop fusion singer Thamsanqa "Tamy" Moyo video-called accomplished South African rapper Cassper Nyovest last December, it could have been viewed as sheer luck. "Never say never y'all. This just happened two minutes ago @casspernyovest. It's called Grace hope one day something can come out of this (Zim and SA flags emojis). If this is all it will ever be, I'm just as grateful. I took a chance and made it count," an ecstatic Moyo posted a screenshot of the surreal moment on her Instagram page. But, last Monday it was more than chance when South African artiste Babes Wodumo took notice of the young sensation going a step further by liking her posts on the same platform. "When a queen recognises another queen @babes_wodumo," Tamy captioned a screenshot which shows a series of likes for her snaps by the queen of South Africa's Gqom music. A listen to her recent work proves that Tamy, who is back in the country after a three-month African artistes' European tour, is indeed destined for greatness. Her work may not have only charmed music followers within the local confines, if the foreign celebrities' social media attention is anything to go by. Fresh from a successful tour of Germany, Austria and Switzerland where she dished out stellar performances for different crowds, Tamy is destined for bigger things. The tour, dubbed Mother Africa Tour, saw Tamy sharing stages with various artistes from across Africa She is riding on the fair success of her debut album, The 18th Rollercoaster, featuring songs such as Ndibereke and Sango. The 19-year-old songbird started singing at the age of seven while she was in primary school and at 13, she released two singles, Celebrate Your Life and African Beat.
