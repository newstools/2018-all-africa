Ever since the victory of Adwa, Ethiopia has been at the heart of African independence struggle against both colonialism and new form of modern day dominance, says Ambassador Jean Mfasoni, Special Advisor to the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. The Victory of Adwa is a source of pride for Africans. It is also a landmark that Africans through Ethiopia ascertained their will to be sovereign, independent and free from any form of foreign colonial domination. "It is an honor for the AU to show that recognition to Ethiopian gallant patriots who had made it possible for the country to remain free and independent and making the voice of Africa heard around the globe," he adds. It is a victory not just for Ethiopia but for all oppressed nations of Africa. It is a cornerstone for African resistance against injustice and suppression that African nations cherish and recognize, the Ambassador notes. According to Ambassador Jean, Ethiopia as a founding member of the UN had fought to accelerate the liberation of Africa and it has also been a cradle for the establishment of Organization of African Unity and AU, the continuation in another form of the fight to be fully independent. The Continent must achieve full economic and socio-cultural independence and Ethiopia is in this regard remains an example playing a leading role among other nations, in the full liberation of the Continent. Achieving a united, integrated, peaceful and prosperous Africa then would be possible if other countries follow suits. The AU will be open to any initiative to promote Adwa which laid strong foundation for pan-Africanism and it welcomes the proposed Adwa Pan-African University and it will see what kind contribution the Union will do to realize the project.
