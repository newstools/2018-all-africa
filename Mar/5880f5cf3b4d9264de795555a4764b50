In fact, he gave us N15million out of his N30billion (okay I was joking). He had already spoken to every other person before me because I was out of town and when he eventually told me, the first thing I asked him was if he had called Don Jazzy. David told me he was just returning from Don Jazzy's house at midnight. After some back and forth, we finally agreed."
