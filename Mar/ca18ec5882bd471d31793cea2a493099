Sauti Sol are planning to launch their new album this year and it seems they still have a few collaborations up their sleeve. Rapper Khaligraph Jones will this week release his collabo with the award winning group. Khaligraph has lately been releasing one hit track after another, and confirmed that something good is cooking. As it stands no one yet knows the genre of the track. Sauti Sol are expected to release their album Afrikan Sauce later in the year.
