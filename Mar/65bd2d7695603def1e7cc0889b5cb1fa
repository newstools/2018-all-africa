Maiduguri â€” REFUGEE rights groups have bemoaned the imminent closure of camps housing millions of Nigerians displaced by the Boko Haram terror northeast of the country. The West African country is planning to close all refugee camps by May and facilitate large-scale returns in the Borno State, especially to remote areas only recently secured from the terrorists. Refugees International (RI) expressed alarm at the plans. "We are concerned that many returns are being fueled by official pressure and the spread of misinformation," Alexandra Lamarche, RI Advocate for Sub-Saharan Africa, said. Authorities are accelerating plans to return the displaced civilians as Nigeria approaches its national elections in early 2019. Mark Yarnell, RI Senior Advocate, said while the Nigerian military had liberated a number of areas in the northeast Nigeria from Boko Haram control, major security challenges remained. "Making large-scale returns for the majority of displaced civilians is entirely premature," Yarnell said. As a result of the Boko Haram banditry, the scale of the humanitarian and security challenges within Nigeria remains staggering. About 2 million Nigerians are displaced within the country and 7,7 million in urgent need of emergency assistance. Additionally, the conflict still results in new displacement. Humanitarian groups estimate more than 930 000 Nigerians are located in hard-to-reach areas impacted by the security situation are likely in need of humanitarian assistance. The Boko Haram is perpetrating a violent campaign to overthrow the government an establish a radical Islamic state. An estimated 100 000 civilians have been killed during the insurgency that begand in 2009.
