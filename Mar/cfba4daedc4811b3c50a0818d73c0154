Fresh memories concerning the deaths of Davido's friends, Tagbo Umeike and DJ Olu, who both died under mysterious circumstances in October 2017, still lingers as the last is yet to be heard of the saga. The night of October 3, 2017 was Tagbo's birthday, his friends, including late DJ Olu, late Chime Amechina and Davido hung out together at the Shisha Lounge, Lekki. It was to be a memorable night but eventually turned out to be a disastrous night to remember, as Tagbo Umeike turned up dead while DJ Olu and Chime Amechina also lost their lives mysteriously. In a recent chat with E-Daily, Davido's Togolese-born producer, Fresh VDM, disclosed how he was instrumental to Davido's recovery from the daunting experience. "Trust me it was a tough time and everyone wore a gloomy face. I wanted to see the normal David. I just felt I needed to do something to see happiness and joy back in the Davido Music Worldwide (DMW), especially on Davido's face." "So I went and made a beat that will assist David to re-channel all the emotions he was feeling at the time. Thankfully, he liked the beat and sent me a voice note with his lyrics. We then headed to the studio to record a new song", he said. Fresh VDM disclosed this, as he recently produced an African anthem by South Africa's Cassper Nyovest and Davido. The track titled 'Check On You" was recorded during Cassper's visit to Nigeria in January, 2018 where he linked up with the FIA superstar and the Togolese-born Nigerian-bred producer, as the Nate Thomas-directed video was shot on location in South Africa on Davido's trip to the country in February.
