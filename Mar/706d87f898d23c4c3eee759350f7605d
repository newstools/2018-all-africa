The government has released a list of companies and individuals who allegedly externalised foreign currency and have not heeded President Emmerson Mnangagwa's call to return the funds. Days after assuming office last November, Mnangagwa issued a three-month ultimatum for those who externalised funds and assets to return them with no questions asked. He added that he would publish the names of those people who ignore his call and then the law would take its course.
