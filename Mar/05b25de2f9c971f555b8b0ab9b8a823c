Johannesburg â€” HUAWEI and its channel partners have hosted a certification award ceremony as well as interview sessions for 19 Huawei Authorised Information and Network Academy (HAINA) graduates for the second time in a year. Graduates consisted of senior students from Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) and the University of Johannesburg (UJ). The HAINA initiative is a global information and communications technology (ICT) education programme that facilitates university-enterprise partnership. The programme aims to lead ICT development, build the future of the industry and create a sound personnel ecosystem by providing education worldwide. The joint academy established with TUT in 2015, became the first HAINA installation in the Southern Africa region. Maison Mei, Business Service Director of Huawei Enterprise South Africa, said the Southern Africa region was a vital area of growth for the HAINA programme. Mei said Huawei was committed to providing its global leading expertise in local ICT personnel cultivation, to help accelerate the development of educational tools and promote the development of the local ICT technical workforce. "As such, we would like to congratulate the graduates on their momentous milestone," Mei added. Huawei partners Altron, Datacentrix, Reflex and StorTech will have priority to the students for internships and employment opportunities. Huawei is working with over 300 universities around the world to build its ICT academies. It has signed contracts with over 100 training partners. Huawei's ICT technical certification programme is the industry's only certification that covers all technical fields. Over 80 000 engineers have received this certification. There are now over 5 000 Huawei Certified Internetwork Experts (HCIEs), the highest-level technical certification offered by Huawei.
