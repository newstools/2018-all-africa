Abu Shouk Camp â€” The Darfur displaced have strongly condemned attempts by the North Darfur government to forcibly dismantle and re-plan Abu Shouk camp for enforce return under the pretext of voluntary repatriation. In a statement on Wednesday, Sheikh Abdelrazig Yousef, the spokesman for the Coordination odfor Displaced and Refugees, said that "these attempts are being carried out in cooperation with some of the so-called weak souls in accordance with a studied plan to dismantle the camps". Sheikh Yousef described the government's ongoing plan to dismantle the camps as "a continuation of the crimes of genocide, ethnic cleansing and forced displacement by the elites of Khartoum government". He told Radio Dabanga that in order to implement this, the regime has stopped humanitarian aid for more than four months in a row as a pressure. He confirmed the displaced people's categorical rejection of the government's plans to dismantle the rest of the camps in all Darfur and the introduction of the national number in exchange for the distribution of food rations for the displaced. He called on the United Nations and all international and regional human rights and humanitarian organisations to provide urgent health and food services in order to save the lives in these camps because they are now facing slow death and prevent their transfer. Also he called on the UN Security Council to send international forces with adequate powers to protect us from the Janjaweed militias and the other militias that Khartoum government has used, such as the rapid support and others.
