The heavy downpour that rocked the capital this morning brought forth agony and hilarity in equal measure. While Nairobi residents grappled with flooded streets, traffic jams and the suddenly icy weather, there was another group behind their keyboards who had so much fodder for themselves. With the hashtag #NairobiRains, they helped to temper the gloom that gripped the city by the scruff of its neck. Victor Mochere put in: Just woke up to find my car floating in my neighbour's yard. Took an Uber, we started floating on the road. Tried to walk, accidentally slipped into a ditch, I had to swim to work. I could have called in sick but my phone was carried away back home by water.#NairobiRains - Inspired by Jesus (@VictorMochere) March 15, 2018 Ezra Mokobi tweeted: Irony is being swept by the Nairobi floods while driving a Noah #NairobiDownpour #NairobiRains - Ezra™ Mokobi (@ezrahmo) March 15, 2018 Miss Kimola had problems of her own. Tweeted she: Who can relate with this struggle when it rains? And when you remove them you stagger into puddles #PeoplewithGlasses #NairobiRains pic.twitter.com/Ud5JSvj8IQ - Miss Kimola (@CynthiaKimola) March 15, 2018 For some crafty Nairobi folks, this was time to make extra moolah. How so? Making bridges using their tools of trade (trolleys) for people to cross flooded streets. And some, actually most, Nairobians parted with money. Talk of cast iron opportunism.

The irony of all this rain and floods is that ... . no one will remember to harvest this water and in two months we shall be raising funds because of drought #NairobiRains pic.twitter.com/hTTNY9rtMV - Peter Gacheru (@pgacheru) March 15, 2018 But the clincher?

And today was their day.
