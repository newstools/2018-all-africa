At least 20 families of ex-combatants, comprising war casualties and vulnerable army retirees, last week received new housing units constructed for them by the Rwanda Demobilisation and Reintegration Commission (RDRC), Rwanda Defence Forces and other stakeholders. Other partners in the exercise include Rwanda Institute of Cooperatives Entrepreneurship and Finance, Imbuto Foundation, the Rwanda Children's Commission, and the Kayonza District. According to a statement, the houses were constructed in a model village in Kageyo Cell, Mwiri Sector, Kayonza District. The model village was launched on Friday in an event that was attended by, among others, Lt. Gen. Jacques Musemakweli, the RDF Chief of Staff (Land Forces), the Chairperson of RDRC, Seraphine Mukantabana and the Governor of Eastern Province, Fred Mufuluke. Musemakweli said it was a culture in the RDF fraternity to help anyone that is in need, including their own. He specifically thanked Rwandans in Diaspora, especially members of the RDF on peacekeeping mission in Darfur, Sudan, for their contribution towards the project. Governor Mufuluke urged the ex-combatants to make good use of the infrastructure given to them as part of the model village including a school and health facility.
