Exactly a year after his release from prison, Teddy Ssezi Cheeye - former director of economic monitoring at the Internal Security Organisation - has been killed by a boda boda rider while crossing a road. Cheeye was released last March after serving 10 years for corruption. He was founder and publisher of the anti-corruption magazine Uganda Confidential.
