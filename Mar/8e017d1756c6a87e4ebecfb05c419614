Johannesburg â€” PAN-African telecommunications group, Liquid Telecom, is expanding extensive voice services across six countries in the continent. Liquid Telecom, a subsidiary of Econet Global, has selected Metaswitch solutions as the basis of expansion in Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The network will also support deployment of the Metaswitch Accession Communicator unified communications and collaboration (UC&C) application. David Behr, Group Chief Product Officer at Liquid Telecom, said the Metaswitch solution would enable his company expand its business voice service footprint and portfolio rapidly by deploying a centralized network with regional hubs and much lighter networks in each country it served. This significantly lowers expenditure for services like SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunking and hosted UC and is backed by Metaswitch's superior professional services and support organizations. "Metaswitch has been a true partner to us throughout," Behr said. Liquid Telecom is a leading communications services and solutions provider across 13 countries in Eastern, Central and Southern Africa that serves carrier, enterprise and retail customers with high-speed, reliable connectivity and digital services. It has built Africa's largest independent fiber network, spanning over 50 000 km, and operates state-of-the-art data centers in Johannesburg, Cape Town (both South Africa) and Nairobi (Kenya). "Agile providers like Liquid often out-innovate global incumbents, driven as they are to push the edge of network and service velocity using network functions virtualization," said Martin Lund, Chief Executive Officer of Metaswitch.
