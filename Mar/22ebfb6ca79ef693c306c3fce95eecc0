It is a scandal, a shame and a terrible indictment of our press (who are doing so much to reveal the problems of the country) that the change in the greatest crisis in our country, HIV infections, has gone so under-reported. On 12 March, the Institute for Race Relations released a report about the fall off in new HIV infections. In nine years this has fallen by 39%. New HIV/Aids infections declined countrywide from 437,705 to 266,931 between 2009 and 2016. This news, on an illness which has crippled the lives of more South African families than any other issue, hardly got a mention in the media. It is a scandal, a shame and a terrible indictment of our press (who are doing so much to reveal the problems of the country), that the change in the greatest crisis in our country has gone so under-reported. HIV/Aids affects the vast majority of South Africans more than anything else that has been covered in the last months. Forget Jacob Zuma and his legal battles. Forget Julius Malema and land grabs in the name of political expediency. Forget Cyril Ramaphosa grappling with the Medusa of ANC graft and corruption. Forget Tom Monyane...
