The sentencing of the man accused of killing Top Billing presenter Simba Mhere has been postponed to April 19 and 20. The defence asked for the matter to be postponed because a report by the probation officer was incomplete. Preshalin Naidoo, who was found guilty of culpable homicide following the death of Mhere in a car crash, appeared briefly in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Friday. He was found guilty in January on two counts of culpable homicide, as well as negligent and reckless driving. In his judgment previously, Magistrate David Mahango rejected Naidoo's entire defence. He dismissed Naidoo's version of events that he was travelling at 61km/h at the time of the collision. Naidoo's car tracker had recorded 37 incidents of him exceeding the speed limit. Minutes before the accident, Naidoo had been travelling at 210km/h. Source: News24
