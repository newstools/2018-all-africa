Zi-Dancehall Empire, a brainchild of ZiFM will this weekend host the first Zimdancehall show in 2018 at the Mbare Netball Complex as they celebrate their second anniversary since they began playing dancehall and reggae music on radio. Zi-dancehall Empire is the combination of Abisha Palmer and DJ 2bad who used to share a slot on ZiFM with DJ Fleva and Ethertone B of Judgment yard. In an interview with 263Chat, Abisha said everything is now set for the show with a lot of artists ready to thrill the ghetto youths who will converge at the popular Zimdancehall show venue. "Now everything is set for the Saturday show at Mbare Netball complex we are preparing for a good show for our fans who have been supporting us for the past 2 years. "A lot of Dancehall artists are coming to support us as well as meeting their fans for the first time in Mbare this year. "Recently Tocky Vibes appeared on a video supporting the ZiDancehall show and I invite all the dancehall lovers to come at Netball Complex this weekend," said Abisha.
