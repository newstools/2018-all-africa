The National Minimum Wage Bill, which was to come into effect on May 1, has hit another snag in parliament and the blame is flying from Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant to organisations like The National Economic Development and Labour Council. The bill before parliament proposes that the National Minimum Wage be set at R20 per hour and be reviewed annually. This as farmworkers and domestic workers earn less.
