Nairobi â€” AT least 15 people have been killed and about 1 000 others evacuated as a result of floods in Kenya. Heavy rain has pummeled the East African country since the beginning of the month culminating in an overflow of water that submerges homes and other structures. The south-west and south-east areas of the country, including the capital Nairobi are the most affected by the inclement conditions. Deaths have been reported in the Central, Nyanza and Eastern Provinces. Evacuations are ongoing in the Coast and Makueni Provinces. The European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, projected the situation to worsen over the coming days. "More heavy rain with local thunderstorms is forecast for the affected areas," the organisation stated. Humanitarian organisations have been making frantic efforts to respond to the crisis that have left scores homeless and in need of basics. In Kenya, which is meanwhile experiencing its worst drought in years, risk of seasonal flooding is usually high during the winter months, July to late August. Floods are also blamed for the recurrent outbreaks of cholera, in a country where almost all urban areas have inadequate rubbish collection and disposal systems. Some 76 people died from about 4 000 cases of the water borne disease confirmed last year.
