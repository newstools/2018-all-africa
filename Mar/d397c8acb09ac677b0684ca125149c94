A joint investigation by the Daily Monitor and NTV Uganda has uncovered sexual abuse and exploitation of refugees in the country. It found that some officials in the prime minister's office, aid agencies and police use their powers to coerce young refugee girls into sex, while the refugee communities themselves have pimps who lure young women from their home countries with the promise of job opportunities.
