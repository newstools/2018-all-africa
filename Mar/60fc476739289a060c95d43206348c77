Judge Fouche Jordaan of the Free State High Court in Bloemfontein has ordered that R10 million (U.S.$839,000) in Atul Gupta's accounts be returned to him. Judge Jordaan ruled in favour of the controversial businessman who filed an application to have a preservation order, obtained against him by the National Prosecuting Authority's Asset Forfeiture Unit, set aside.
