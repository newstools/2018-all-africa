After over a decade of isolation and economic sanctions, Zimbabwe's historic transition has raised the nation'sÂ  expectations, particularly around economic recovery and job creation. Gearing up to face these challenges and preparing Zimbabwe to re-engage with the rest of the world, President Emmerson Mnangagwa will present his country's economic potential to the international investor and business community at the Africa CEO Forum. More than 1,200 personalities, all key industrial, financial and political decision-makers, from over 60 countries, will gather for what is now recognised as the biggest and most important meeting of Africa's private sector.
