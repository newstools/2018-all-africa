"A remote town in north-eastern Nigeria. A government girls' secondary school stormed by gunmen believed to be Boko Haram. Dozens of girls missing. Parents devastated. A town in mourning. These are flashes of the past weeks in Dapchi, an old farming community in Nigeria's Yobe State. It feels eerily similar to Chibok in 2014," writes Chika Oduah for the Voice of America.
