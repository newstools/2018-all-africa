If you are in Europe and you're a fashion enthusiast, get ready for a fashion fiesta where talented Rwandan designers will be showcasing exceptional designs. According to organisers, preparations for the first ever 'Rwandan Diaspora Fashion Show' in Europe are in high gear - and local designers and models are busy getting ready for the runway. The show is organised by Rwandan Women Association and the Embassy of the Netherlands, in collaboration with Kigali International Fashion Week. The objective is to draw attention to the immense talent and sophistication that exists in the fields of culture, fashion and the arts, and to show people how the fashion industry in Rwanda has changed significantly over the past years. The event runs from March 24 to April 1 in The Hague, Netherlands, before it's staged in Brussels, Belgium. In an interview with The New Times, Martin Munguzi, the technical assistant and co-organiser, said everything is set, from the designers and models, to the organisers themselves, to make the show a success. He said it will be a great opportunity to promote Rwandan products. "All I can say is that everything is now set. Designers have plenty to showcase during the exhibition," he said. He added, "I'm optimistic the show will be great and people will appreciate the products. We trust all the designers who will take part in the show and we know they have elegant and unique collections." Traditional ensembles like the umushanana and several other Made-in-Rwanda products will be exhibited. The event, however, is not just about outfits; guests will also enjoy traditional Rwandan dishes in what is dubbed 'Fashion on the Plate' on April 1. 20 labels will showcase their creations at the event. They include Patrick Muhire's collections from Inkanda Fashion House, Delphine Uwamahoro, Cynthia Rupari (Rupari Designs), Hakym Reagan, Mimi Mirenge and Sole & Wax, a Switzerland-based fashion house owned by a Rwandan in the Diaspora, among others.
