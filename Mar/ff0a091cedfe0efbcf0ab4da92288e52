At the outset, the country had planned to haul 4,000 tonnes per trip, peaking at 16,000 tonnes daily; 106,000 tonnes weekly and 5.5 million tonnes annually to break even and repay its construction and operational costs. At the current 12,452 tonnes per week though, the railway would have hauled on average, a mere 647,504 tonnes by the end of the year, casting doubt on the viability of the project, writes Allan Olingo for The East African.
