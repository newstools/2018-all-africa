A Tanzanian user has faced the wrath of Kenyans on Twitter after trying to steal Oscar winning actress Lupita Nyong'o from Kenya. The tweep, Edwin Masobeji using his handle @madeinmwanza, penned an emotional tweet on how proud Tanzania was to be associated with the Black Panther actress. The tweet quickly went viral as Kenyans on Twitter offered to donate other celebrities to Tanzania. Tanzanians on their part defended Masobeji claiming that next they would lay claim to footballer Victor Wanyama. We are proud of you always putting us as Tanzania globally recognized. pic.twitter.com/NvmOs1FF2k -- Edwin â„³asobeji (@madeinmwanza) February 24, 2018 For the first time kuona tweet from Tanzania..

The tweet is grammatically correct, false but good for the entire country. Translation: Watanzania tunawaenzi sana, Platnumz ndio simba dunia nzima.
