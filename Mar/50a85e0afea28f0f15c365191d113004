Dar es Salaam â€” You can now monitor your blood pressure, amount of calories and overall health using a software that is fixed in your wrist watch, thanks to a new high-tech device that was launched on Friday in Dar es Salaam. Dubbed 'Somafit', the device was designed by a group of six students from various universities in Tanzania. Over 100,000 pieces of the device are expected to be produced by the end of this year, according to the company behind the project, Somapps Technologies. Somapps Technologies' Chief Executive Officer Isaya Yunge said this technology is new in Tanzania and was designed by the young men in 2016. He said the youngsters, who are now graduates, are set to secure various scholarships for master's degrees overseas. The company, which started in 2016, currently has a value asset worth $1 million. This year, it plans to hire 40 interns with various skills. They will later be hired on permanent basis. Mr Yunge told The Citizen at the weekend that two innovations Somaapp and Somafit are part of the wider plans to build Google in Africa. In the future, the company wants to connect their device with the doctor and patient so that people can get medical advice before going to hospital. Currently, the company is assembling devices in China due to absence of a factory that manufactures watches in Tanzania. But, the company has plans to establish an assembly factory in the country. "This is our new technology, which is very unique. China is well developed in this area. However, our innovation has surprised them. " he said.
