Former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke has given the government three months to compensate the families of those who died in the Life Esidimeni tragedy. Moseneke delivered his final report in Parktown, Johannesburg, after protracted hearings into the tragedy that led to the deaths of at least 144 mentally ill patients who were transferred to unlicensed, ill-equiped NGOs.
