London — The United Kingdom has announced that it will for the first time appoint a black female career diplomat to the post of High Commissioner. NneNne Iwuji-Eme will be Britain's High Commissioner to Mozambique, replacing Joanna Kuenssberg in July. NneNne Iwuji-Eme has worked for 16 years at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with roles ranging from economic adviser for Africa to chief press officer to the Africa Minister. She has also worked as an economist in the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, and for Royal Dutch Shell. Her most recent posting was to Brazil as First Secretary Prosperity and Acting Prosperity Consul. Commenting on her appointment, NneNne Iwuji-Eme said that “it is an honour and a privilege to be appointed High Commissioner to Mozambique. I hope my appointment as the first British black female career diplomat to this position will inspire young talent, regardless of race or background, to pursue their ambitions in the Foreign Office. I look forward to forging even stronger connections between Britain and Mozambique two close members of the Commonwealth family”. Just under a third of Britain's heads of mission are women, an improvement of two hundred percent over the last decade.
