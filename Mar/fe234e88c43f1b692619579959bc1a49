On Monday, Mad Over You musician, Douglas Agu, popularly known as Runtown, was slammed with a court injunction for "deliberately breaching his contract". His record label, Eric Many, alleged that he has been performing at shows, having collaborations and recording an album without their consent. They also claim that they have not been given their royalties and are asking him to pay the sum of N114,456,670 which they claim was invested in the musician. They also request the sum of "N65m being General Damages against Runtown for infringement of copyright to the collaborative musical works "Call Me" and "Weekend" " and are also asking that he pays the money for the Lamborghini Gallardo. Meanwhile, see the last tweets of the musician whose contract with the label expires this May: Stopped fucking with these kids a month ago ,smh ðŸ˜Š -- Runtown (@iRuntown) March 19, 2018 When you live life beyond your means and go broke, don't try to live off the next man. -- Runtown (@iRuntown) March 19, 2018 It should be recalled that a similar tussle between the artiste and the record label happened in 2016.
