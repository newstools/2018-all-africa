Kesholingo â€” Three youths who reported to a recruitment area for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia in South Darfur died of heat exhaustion on Sunday after spending the day in searing heat without shelter. Informed sources told Radio Dabanga that the government began a recruitment drive for the RSF a week ago. Recruits, some under the age of 18, were ordered to report to an area near Kesholingo village in South Darfur. "They were waiting on a totally barren piece of land without any trees or shelter from the sun," the source said. The death of three of the youths prompted the RSF to change the mustering point to a forested area three kilometres south Kesholingo, where potential recruits can take shelter under trees.
