A UK-based company specialising in selling premium Kenyan tea is exhibiting at the prestigious European Coffee Expo in London this month (May 22 to 23) in an effort to showcase a product that has been declining in price over the past year. Currently, Kenya is ranked third behind China and India in tea production. It remains one of the top foreign exchange earners for Kenya, alongside tourism, horticulture, and coffee. Kenya Tea says it will be "showcasing" its latest premium loose teas and tea bags as well as its new premium grade 100 per cent Arabica green coffee beans at the London expo which is says are "all ethically sourced and imported directly from renowned cooperatives and plantations in Kenya." The UK-based Kenya Tea company is a premium tea importer and wholesaler renowned for its highest quality products which it says are "sourced directly from our artisan producers. Our teas are high grown using sustainable farming methods, and handpicked, producing a distinct flavour and authentic character unique to each tea's location and origin." Kenyan tea is known for its unique high quality, aroma, briskness and taste. Traditionally, it has been exported in bulk to blend and add flavour to some of the world's most respected tea brands. With the UK being the third largest global market for Kenyan tea, the firm says it aims to create a strong UK brand for Kenyan Tea "centred on quality and authenticity," and using only the finest hand-selected tea leaves and high-quality manufacturing processes."
