Kenyans might see less fluctuations in their electricity charges, after Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter directed that they be harmonised to ensure stability. Mr Keter ordered the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to ensure Kenya Power charges in the form of tokens and other modes of domestic consumption stop varying every time users purchase electricity. The order came amid mounting criticism of Kenya Power by Kenyans who accuse it of defrauding them. While addressing complaints by electricity consumers in a session in Nakuru town last week, ERC director-general Pavel Oimeke said from July the cost of electricity per unit will be the same across the board. CRITICISM "We are going to harmonise the charges that are in domestic consumers' tax category to ensure that when they purchase their electricity, the cost per unit does not vary. We are at an advanced stage and by July they will be stable," Mr Oimeke said. He said the government wants to maintain the lifeline tariff, so that lower-rung consumers get a discounted rate. He termed the current mode of electricity payment as complicated. Consumer Federation of Kenya (Cofek) secretary general Stephen Mutoro supported Kenyans in their criticism of Kenya Power and called for a stabilised mode of payment for power consumers. "The current charges system needs to be changed as consumers have complained a lot. We support the move to harmonise the charges," said Mr Mutoro.
