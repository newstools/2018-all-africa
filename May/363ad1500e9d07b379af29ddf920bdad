Lesotho Minister of Health Nkaku Kabi says the government has over the years focused more on the HIV/AIDS crisis and overlooked cancer which is a silent killer. The government spends billions towards cancer treatment for patients in foreign hospitals but the rate of citizens dying due to delays in getting treatment keeps rising, as a result, it is pushing to establish its own cancer center with the assistance of India.
