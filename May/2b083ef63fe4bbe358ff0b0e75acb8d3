Nairobi motorists and passengers had to contend with long hours of traffic snarl-up following a heavy downpour experienced in the city on Wednesday evening. The heavy downpour, which started at around 4pm, left pools of water with some areas submerged in the rain water. The rains also caused a huge shortage of public transport. As a result, passengers had to wait longer for public transport, with those plying the Thika Highway, Mombasa and Jogoo roads being worst affected. Commuters had to bear with a gridlock stretching kilometres on most roads leading into and out of the city. CHAOS In the Central Business District, it was chaos on Moi Avenue, Tom Mboya, Racecourse Road, Ronald Ngala Street, Haile Selassie Avenue, Temple Road and Kimathi Street among others. For some passengers and motorists, the matter was made worse by the fact that Moi Avenue was marked a no go zone for the 14-seater vehicles. Floodwaters also filled major streets and avenues in the city. HEAVY TRAFFIC "All matatus are accessing their terminals either through Kirinyaga Road or Tom Mboya where they have to make a U-turn," reported a Nation reporter. Heavy traffic usually builds up on many of the city's roads in the morning and evenings when commuters enter and leave the CBD, rains usually make the situation even worse.
