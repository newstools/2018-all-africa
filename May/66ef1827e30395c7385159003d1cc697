Luanda — Angolan minister of Former Combatants and Veterans of the Homeland João Ernesto dos Santos "Liberdade" Thursday recommended the need to complete the registration phase of the members of the sector. Addressing an opening ceremony of the XVIII Consultative Council of the Ministry of Former Combatants and Veterans of Homeland in Luanda, the official called for the need to start the creation of conditions for registration process. Under the country's Constitution, the former fighters are entitled to special protection of the Angolan State and society. "We must also make efforts to modernise the registration, creating a safe and credible database that contributes to the control of all those included in the special protection system of former combatants," he said. On the other hand, the minister acknowledged the scarcity of pension allocated to former combatants, war-disabled and relatives of fallen combatants standing at 23,000 Kwanzas which is incompatible with the current cost of living. He also regretted the poor medical assistance provided to the members of Former Combatants. He added that this situation remains a problem to be tackled, despite government effort through ministerial department. As for housing field, he pointed out that there are people who have benefited from housing in the various localities, but today they fail pay the rent, due to the lack of financial resources to support such expenses. The sector controls 160,542 assisted members. The event, running under the theme: Organising the sector to dignify Former Combatants and Motherland Veteran, gathers national and provincial directors, technicians, consultants and guests.
