Cholera outbreak in Amudat District in Karamoja sub region, north eastern Uganda has so far claimed two lives while 48 are currently receiving treatment at Amudat health center IV. According to the Amudat District Chairperson, Mr Francis Kiyonga, the disease has affected the whole Sub County of Loro after it broke out in one of the villages. "We have so far lost two people and 48 are receiving treatment at Amudat health centre IV," he said. He attributed the disease outbreak to lack of access to clean water, adding that the locals had started sharing water with animals from the flowing rivers. Mr Simon Elimu, the Amudat District Health Inspector, said the district has so far created two isolated treatment facilities; one in Loro Sub County and another one at Amudat health centre IV. According to Mr Elimu, the disease could have crossed into Amudat from the neigbouring Kenyan village of Kamketo. He said, the disease got an advantage to spread very fast due to low latrine coverage and poor water systems in the Sub County. "We have so far distributed 4,000 water guard cans that were donated by Signs of Hope, a catholic organization. UNICEF also gave us hand washing facilities to be able to put the situation under control," he said. Mr Elimu appealed to the locals to always keep personal hygiene by using pit latrines and washing hands immediately after.
