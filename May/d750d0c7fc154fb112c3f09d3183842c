THE subsea cable network linking London to Cape Town has been enhanced after a research and education network based in South Africa purchased some systems to that effect. TENET has purchased XKL DarkStar transponder and mux/demux systems, providing a protected connection between two of their strategic data center locations in London. The interconnection is a critical component of a subsea cable network linking the British city and Cape Town. The transponder systems grow to 36x10G in a 1RU package, establish the connection between multi-tenant data centers, which connect to subsea fiber managed by the West African Cable System (WACS). The inclusion of an amplified mux/demux with optical switch protection, was driven by TENET's desire to easily scale its transport capacity as demand increases as well as provide optical path protection between locations in the event of a fibre break. "TENET was looking for a comprehensive data centre interconnect solution that facilitates success-based expansion," commented Dr Chad Lamb, Chief Systems Architect for XKL. Lamb said strategic data centre locations were an increasing trend and XKL has a portfolio of products to support this use case. "It's hard to predict the growth level of traffic that will be needed between sites. The XKL solution provides future expansion capability without the costs typically seen with optical transport solutions," Lamb added. TENET operates multiple peering and transit links across Europe and Africa, as well as UbuntuNet gateways under contract to the UbuntuNet Alliance. "We are impressed with the operational simplicity of the DarkStar equipment," said Len Lotz, Executive Officer/ Technology and Operations for TENET. Lotz said after experimenting with XKL's online demonstration systems, provisioning and bringing up service was easy. "This was the first of several projects and we've been impressed with XKL's products and engagement," Lotz added.
