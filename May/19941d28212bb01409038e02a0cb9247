The Commissioner for Environment, Lagos State, Mr. Babatunde Durosinmi-Etti, has disclosed that the Epe landfill under construction by Visionscape is making remarkable progress with the completion of the weighbridge and other facilities. Speaking at a briefing in Lagos, he also noted that Portland Energy & Power was mobilizing to site for the commencement of work on engineered hazardous landfill in Badagry, a statement said. The CEO of Visionscape Sanitation Solutions (a waste management company providing turnkey solutions in the area of integrated waste management), John Irvine, speaking on the project, explained that: "We had to dig deeper than expected to excavate previous waste material and set up a strong foundation. We've built the weighbridge and the control tower. The next phase is the remediation work." According to a statement, Irvine said the Epe EcoPark will feature a material recovery facility, an anaerobic digestion plant and a waste to energy plant amongst other features. He also said the company also planned to incorporate existing landfill miners (scavengers) into the waste management value chain by including them in the recycling and recovery activities in the park. The Commissioner for Environment, however, reiterated the state's commitment to providing the infrastructure required to support the environmental management of the state with over 22 million residents. Details of the briefing included the recruitment of over 13,000 Community Sanitation Workers to clean the inner streets, mechanized street sweeping to be managed by three private companies, Avatar, Wastecare and Corporate Solutions. The completion of 48 mini-waterworks across the state, including the implementation of innovative technology for water management and drainage maintenance remains with the Lagos State Public Works Corporation.
