Troops and Boko Haram terrorists exchanged gunfire at Auno, a community in Kada local government area of Borno State. The terrorist group reportedly invaded the village with gun trucks and tricycles. "The battle is ongoing as I speak to you. The attackers struck like 15 minutes ago," he said to The Cable. It was later gathered that security operatives succeeded in repelling the militants. The incident occurred one week after members of Boko Haram tried to invade Maiduguri, Borno capital, but were pushed back by a combined team of the air force, police and army. Officials of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were later deployed in the Jidarri Polo area of the ancient city, where the battle took place. The military authorities are yet to react to the latest attack.
