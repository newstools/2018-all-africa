Luanda — Four new Q400 aircraft, from the six requested by Angola to Canadian manufacturer Bombardier, are due to arrive in Luanda in 2019, the transport minister said Saturday. Augusto da Silva Tomás was speaking exclusively to Angop, on the sidelines of the signing of the contract for the acquisition of six aircraft, between the new domestic airline operator Air Connection Express and the Canadian Bombardier. "Everything is being handled between the parties, so that the planes arrive in the country as soon as possible, since they depend on the start of operations, but in principle the first four will arrive in 2019 and the other two in 2020," he said. He reported that each Bombardier, type DH8-Q400, is valued at over $ 23 million.
