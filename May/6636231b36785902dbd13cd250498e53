Troops of Operation Lafiya Dole were on Tuesday decorated with their new ranks, a special promotion by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Tukur Yusufu Buratai, for soldiers who actively participated in Operation DEEP PUNCH II. The decoration of the troops was conducted by their Commanders in Bama, Chibok, Damboa, Dikwa, Gwoza, Konduga and Maiduguri respectively. In a statement signed by the Director of Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Texas Chukwu, he said that the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 7 Division Nigerian Army, Major General Ibrahim Manu Yusuf attributed the COAS gesture to recognition of troops valour and commitment to duty during the Operation DEEP PUNCH II. Yusuf in the statement said that the courage and valour of the troops led to the successful demolition of the stronghold of Boko Haram terrorists in Sambisa Forest. He thanked the COAS for his benevolence which he noted would spur the troops more in subsequent operations. He paid glowing tribute to soldiers who paid the supreme sacrifice during the Operation and charged those promoted to reciprocate the gesture of the COAS by rededicating themselves to the fight against terrorism in the North East.
