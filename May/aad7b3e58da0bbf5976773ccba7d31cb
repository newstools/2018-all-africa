Arusha â€” ABOUT 300 wealthy visitors from Australia who have just completed the Tanzanian itinerary of their global tour have vowed to return. "We are definitely going to return here," they vowed after sampling attractions in Serengeti and Tarangire National Parks. Speaking on behalf of others, Ms Leslie Watts, said the Tanzania wildlife as experienced from Serengeti and Tarangire were splendid and they all agreed to keep returning on annual basis and possibly sample other attractions in the country as well. Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB) Managing Director Devotha Mdachi said here yesterday that the delegation from Australia has opened doors to more visitors from Sidney. "The top four foreign countries that bring tourists to Tanzania are United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Sweden; Australia is also in the top ten listing though the number of visitors from Sydney remains low," said Ms Mdachi, adding that the 2018 delegation from Sidney will help boost the number. Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA) Director General, Dr Allan Kijazi pointed out that the 300 visitors aboard the chartered plane are touring among other countries, Tanzania, Morocco, the United States, Cuba, France and India, but it is only in Tanzania that they chose to sample wildlife. "This goes to show that our national parks stand out globally because it is only here the visitors wanted to tour game parks and their experience in both Serengeti and Tarangire as far as their feedback is concerned, was splendid," revealed Dr Kijazi. The manager for Tourism services at the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Mr Paul Fisoo, said unfortunately this year, the delegation from Aussie could not visit the legendary Ngorongoro Crater but many have expressed interest to return next year and go down the caldera. The wealthy visitors from Australia jetted into the country over the weekend aboard the Qantas Boeing 747-400 Plane, with 310 tourists aboard and left for Morocco yesterday afternoon.
