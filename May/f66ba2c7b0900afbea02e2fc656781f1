On June 29, the UN Security Council renewed Unamid's mandate for another year. It also decided on a reduction of the peacekeepers "in two six-month phases while closely monitoring the situation on the ground." More than a third of the nearly 19,000 Unamid military troops and police officers were to be withdrawn. In September last year, rebel movements protested the alleged handing of two North Darfur bases to the country's main militia. With the handing of the Zamzam team site in North Darfur to the Sudanese authorities on October 21, 2017, Unamid completed the first phaseof the reduction. Darfur displaced, Sudanese politicians, and international activists have all warned for the consequences of a downsizing of the number of peacekeepers for the people in Darfur.
