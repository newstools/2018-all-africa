Mombasa Senator Mohamed Faki has urged Governor Hassan Joho to scale up clearing of garbage to prevent disease outbreaks. "Littering is a major problem in Mombasa. Residents should stop dumping rubbish at undesignated spots. "We are concerned that diseases might erupt due to the garbage and onset of rains," Mr Faki said during the launch of a clean-up exercise on Sunday in Nyali. DISEASES Senator Faki also wants the VOK dumpsite in Nyali to be closed down as it poses health hazards. The clean-up campaign dubbed 'Talanta Na Usafi campaign 2018' was started by a non-governmental organisation, Center for Water Governance (CWG). There are fears that the rains and floods might trigger outbreaks of infectious diseases such as chikungunya and dengue fever, which the regional government has been trying to eradicate since last year. TOURISM Ms Victoria Nzioka, the executive director, further said the initiative will make the region more attractive to tourists. "This initiative will give the tourist resort city a facelift. Garbage is strewn all over the town posing a threat to residents. We should keep the environment clean, hygiene is important," Ms Nzioka said. Volunteers removed waste from gutters, clogged sewers and swept the streets.
