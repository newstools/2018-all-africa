ECD Hygiene & Drought Awareness Campaign comes to Langa crèche The Western Cape Social Development MEC, Albert Fritz, continued the Department's Early Childhood Development (ECD) Hygiene & Drought Awareness Campaign by handing over 110 hygiene packs to children at the Luthando Pre-School in Langa. The hygiene packs were generously donated by NGO-partner, Al-Imdaad, and each pack consists of; Toilet Roll, Toothpaste, Tooth Brush, Vaseline, Lotion, Soap, Face Cloth. Given the start of the colder weather ahead of winter, the Minister also handed over 110 beanies (woollen hats), and 30 blankets. This campaign has focussed on raising awareness about the need for children to maintain good hygiene practices, such as consistent hand washing, even through a drought and cold weather. Children in crèches can be susceptible to illness and diseases, if good hygiene practices are not followed. Some of the most common illnesses at crèches include colds and flu, diarrhoea and rashes. These hygiene packs and ongoing awareness initiatives will ensure we can prevent the outbreak of diseases, such as the national listeriosis outbreak, at our ECD centres. The Luthando Pre-School is managed by, Beauty Ngqakayi, who has led its water-saving efforts. The facility has cut water usage by having children wash their hands in a basin with disinfectant and re-used grey water for toilet flushing. We commend them for their efforts to help save water. We all need to continue saving water, and use less than 50 litres per person per day. We cannot be complacent, given that we require as much water in storage as possible heading into the 2018/19 summer. Issued by: Western Cape Social Development
