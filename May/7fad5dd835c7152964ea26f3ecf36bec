A solider attached to the special Forces Command (SFC) is nursing injuries after he was on Wednesday night stabbed in the stomach by unknown person as he enjoyed a social evening at California P&J transit hotel in Kigongi ward Kabale town. The police spokesman for Kigezi Sub-region, Mr Elly Maate said Stephen Kankiriho was rushed to Mbarara regional referral hospital where he was immediately operated. The motive is yet to be established as police are still investigating the incident which Mr Maate says was as a result of a misunderstanding between the soldier and his alleged attacker who is still at large. Mr Maate added that after the incident, police conducted an operation in which about 54 people were arrested to help them in the investigations as they try to trace Mr Kankiriho's alleged assailant. Kigongi ward in Kabale town is a place where most sex workers mainly speaking Kinyarwanda operate from. Last September, police picked the body of an 18-year old alleged sex worker from the same area after she was reportedly strangled by her love after developing a misunderstanding and the culprit has never been arrested. On March 9, the police picked another body of a woman also said to be a sex worker in the same area after she was allegedly murdered by stranger. Her assailants have never been arrested.
