Osogbo â€” INDICATIONS emerged, yesterday, that the management of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, and Osun State government may have resolved their disagreement occasioned by the non-remittance of taxes by the university. A top management of the university told Vanguard last night that a sum of N25 million had been paid into the state government's account since last week. Confirming the payment, Special Adviser, Tax Matters to Osun State government, Mr. Gbenga Akano said the OAU management informed him that a sum of N25 million had been paid from the backlog. He said the institution may be reopened today (Tuesday), while further negotiations on the matter between the parties continue. It would be recalled that Osun state government had last week shut down the university alleging that a sum of N1.8 billion deducted from the institution's staff salary as withholding tax was not remitted to the government. But the university, while reacting to government's claim, dismissed the allegation, saying it never withheld the deductions, but it under deducted from staffers salaries. OAU management put the amount it owed Osun government in unremitted taxes at N287 million. Multiple sources in the know of various meetings between the two parties, however, reliably informed Vanguard that a sum of N 25million has been paid to the government. The source said: "There have been several meetings between the two parties to get the matter resolved. I can confirm to you that a sum of N25 million has been paid by OAU management to Osun state government. "Normal activities will return to campus very soon. The matter is partially resolved. Modalities to defray the outstanding sum are being worked out."
