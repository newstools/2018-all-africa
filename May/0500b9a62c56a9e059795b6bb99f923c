One of Zimbabwe's fastest rising hip hop trap artist Crooger has dropped an official music video for his hit single, "Harare Hucci" featuring Briss Mbada. In the song, Crooger born Nyasha Gurure, tackles a controversial topic that is apparent and known in the modern day culture where women use their looks as a means of survival. Crooger said the single was meant to raise awareness of what was happening with a lot of young women, warning them of the consequences. "I just wanted to directly confront this issue because it is becoming prevalent by the day. Young women need to know that being attractive is not a profession nor a means of survival because it fades. Some end up getting deadly diseases because they use their bodies to earn a living," said Crooger. The video was visually shot by Aaron Mheta of AM Pictures while the single was produced by GTbeats which has been behind various hits such as Rugare ft Winky d & Buffalo Souljah Crooger recently signed a branding and management deal with one of the industries' established executive producers, Abra Simzz. The internationally acclaimed producer and radio personality did not waste time in praising the versatile and hungry for success Crooger. "He is a very determined and hardworking young man headed in the right direction. I am happy to be working with him because he know what he wants, and that is to be the best artist he can be. People should look out for exciting projects from us," said Simmz. Crooger is set to release various singles and videos throughout the rest of the year with various artists including a collaboration remix with Swaziland artist Trippy king and Nigerian star Ice Prince later this year.
