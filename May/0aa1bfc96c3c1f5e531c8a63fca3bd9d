Last month, a family of five had a lucky escape after their vehicle got submerged in rain water following flash floods inside the park. It took the rescue effort of a team of KWS rangers to evacuate the marooned family, 10 minutes after the distress call was made to their main office. Senior Warden at the Nairobi National Park, Nelly Kendogor, said the family of five that consisted of three adults and two children, had embarked on a game drive around midday when tragedy struck. "We received a call from one of the rangers informing us of their situation. Our team quickly responded and we were successful in evacuating the family trapped in the van," Kendogor said.
