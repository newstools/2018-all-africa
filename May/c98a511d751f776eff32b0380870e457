Has Citizen TV anchor Anne Kiguta broken up with the father of her twins, Jomo Gecaga? This is the question on some Kenyan's minds after the TV siren deleted a video that she had uploaded wishing Jomo a Happy Father's Day last year. Jomo, who is President Uhuru Kenyatta's nephew and personal assistant, reportedly took paternity leave in July 2016 when Kiguta delivered the twins, a boy and a girl. Reports of the two being an item swirled when they attended a James Bond movie screening holding hands. On Father's Day in 2017, Kiguta posted a video of Jomo and her first born daughter, Wairimu from her previous relationship, having a daddy daughter moment and wished him a Happy Father's Day. The video has since been deleted from her account but below is a screenshot.
