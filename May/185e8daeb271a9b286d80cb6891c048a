Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo has called for an urgent humanitarian assistance to thousands of Somalis affected by river floods in Beledweyne town. A delegation led president Farmajo has arrived in Beledweyne, the regional capital of Hiran on Monday to show solidarity with the flood victims. The President and his delegation are on an assessment mission to the situation of the town following heavy floods washed away parts of the city and forced residents to displace. The President's visit comes on the heel of intensifying floods after River Shabelle breached its banks. At least five people died in river flooding inundated the town, according to the local authorities. The victims have drowned after the floods washed them away. Last Friday, HirShabelle president Mohamed Abdi Waare has called on the government and humanitarian aid agencies to respond urgently before the situation turns into tragic. "We urge the Federal Government and humanitarian agencies help these flood victims in the region. People have no place to sleep, clothes, clean water to drink, food and medicine," said the governor.
