Was arrested Qorane's poems were found offending to Somaliland, her homeland, which declared independence from Somalia. The poetess was arrested and detained at the Hargeisa airport upon returning from Mogadishu to visit her family. Human rights advocates in Somaliland had condemned the sentencing of the poetess. The groups expressed joy upon her release. Freedom of speech The director of Somaliland Human Rights Centre, Mr Guled Ahmed Jama, said: "I am glad that poet Naema Ahmed Ibrahim has been released on a presidential pardon."

The relatively stable Somaliland has failed to win international recognition since it declared independence from the rest of Somalia.
