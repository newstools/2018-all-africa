Kenyan actor Joseph Kinuthia aka Omosh has recounted his long struggle with alcohol addiction, admitting that at one point he could barely 'function' without a drink. The actor, who has starred for years in his role as an errant school groundsman in the TV drama Tahidi High, made the revelation in a recent interview with a local media house. "Let's just say I really consumed a lot of alcohol over the past 20 years. I could not function without alcohol in my system. I remember at times I had to hide from my colleagues to take a sip or tot to be able to function," the father of four recounted. BATTLE WITH ALCOHOLISM "I could get off stage during a show, or even find an excuse to leave home so that I can take a drink," he further added. Omosh, who also is an emcee, says he finally quit drinking because the habit was draining his finances to an extent he was often unable to cater for his family's needs. The visibly healthier Omosh is the second media personality - after journalist Oliver Mathenge - to come out and share his past battle to shake off alcoholism.
