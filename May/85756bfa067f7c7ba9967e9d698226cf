CNN African Voices sponsored by the grandmasters of data, Globacom, will this week take another look at art and its unique manifestations on the African continent especially the ingenious ways artists are communicating their Africa to the world. The programme tees off in Nairobi, Kenya, where 49 year-old Patrick Mukabi will inform viewers about his first love, the fine arts. "My entire working process is usually visible to the keen eye. My subject is based on everyday activities especially of women. These are people I meet and see on daily bases", Patrick enthused on his art. A self - taught photographer focusing on unlikely subjects in his exhibits, Adiodato Gomes, is the second guest on African Voices. The 46 year old who also doubles as Production Director of Cultural Events takes poetic street photographs which show pure and difficult reality of life. Viewers should catch CNN African Voices on the Cable News Network, CNN, at 9.30 a.m. on Friday. Repeat editions will be broadcast at 3.30 a.m. and 1.30 p.m. on Saturday and 11.30 a.m and 6.30 p.m. on Sunday. Further repeats will be broadcast at 10.30 a.m. on Monday and 4.30 a.m. on Tuesday. The third leg of the tripod on the programme is an internationally acclaimed street and studio-based artist, Wise Two, whose work is highly influenced by African culture and his Indian heritage. His forte is deciphering hieroglyphs, ancient cultures and mystical graffiti.
