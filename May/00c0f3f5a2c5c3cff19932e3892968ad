Former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has changed her Twitter bio after being prompted by award winning author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. During an interview on April 22, Adichie had put Hillary to task on why her bio started with "Wife". "Your Twitter account, the first word that describes you is "wife" and then I think its "mom" and then "grandmother" and when I saw that I have to confess that I felt just a little bit upset and then I went and I looked at your husband's Twitter account, the first word was not "husband" and I wanted to ask first of all if this was your choice, if this was something you wanted to do or something that maybe somebody thought will be a good idea for the campaign?" Adiche asked her. In reply, Hillary said; "When you put it like that, I'm going to change it." The interview was part of the 2018 PEN World Voices Festival in the United States. BUZZ ONLINE Chimamanda's question to Hillary created a buzz online and offline. Some were in support, others felt she had no right to question Ms Clinton's choices. Chimamanda later wrote a post explaining what had transpired during that interview. As promised, Hilary has changed her Twitter bio. Her Twitter bio had read: "Wife, Mom. Grandma, Women+kids advocate, FLOTUS, Senator, SecState, Hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, 2016 presidential candidate. Tweets from Hillary signed -H" It now reads: "2016 Democratic Nominee, SecState, Senator, hair icon. Mom, Wife, Grandma x2, lawyer, advocate, fan of walks in the woods & standing up for our democracy."
