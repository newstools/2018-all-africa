Nairobi â€” The government has formed a task force to establish the reasons for low water levels at Ndakaini Dam - the largest source of water for Nairobi - despite persistent heavy rains. Principal Secretary for Water Joseph Irungu says the task force will be required to look into all issues surrounding the management of the dam that has been the centre of concern for months now. This follows worries that the levels of dam remained drastically low, despite the heavy rainfall being experienced in the country. The task force will have representatives from the water Ministry, Nairobi and Muranga Counties, Athi Water and Sewerage Company, Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company among other stakeholders. Engineer Samuel Halima will lead the probe, set to be done in two months.
