A section of flood victims in Kilifi want the county government to distribute condoms in their camps. More than 6,000 residents were displaced and most of them are camping at Garashi in Magarini. Elders at the camp urged the government to consider the issue as urgent. "The need for condoms here is great. Some of us came with our teenagers and, since they are sexually active, our fear is that they may engage in unprotected sex, which could lead to infections," said Mzee Kitsao.
