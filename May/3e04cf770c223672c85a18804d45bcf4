The owner of a private game reserve near Thabazimbi in Limpopo has been hospitalised after being mauled by one of his lions. In a short video clip, the man is seen walking behind the lion in a den. The lion spots him and chases him as he runs for a metal gate. The lion then drags him into nearby bushes where he then lies motionless. (Video contains graphic content).
