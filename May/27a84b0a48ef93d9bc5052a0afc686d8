Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga has ordered Security Minister Elly Tumwiine to vacate Nommo Gallery or pay U.S.$432,000 in outstanding rent. Parliament investigated Tumwiine's occupancy of the gallery, a public facility set up by Ugandan and foreign artists in 1964. According to a parliamentary committee, Creations Limited, a private company owned by Tumwiine, has been occupying the gallery since 1998 but has never paid rent.
