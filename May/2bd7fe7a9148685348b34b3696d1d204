President Yoweri Museveni has defended the government's controversial move to import Cuban doctors, a plan that was first mooted during a strike over poor pay and poor working conditions last year. Speaking at Labour Day celebrations in Sembabule, Museveni said: "A doctor who goes on a strike is not a doctor. He is an enemy of the people."
