Four people are missing after their vehicle was swept away by a swollen river in Kitui County. Family members of the victims say they suspect the four, a driver and three passengers, may have been killed while crossing River Enziu in Nuu two weeks ago. They were on their way to attend a burial ceremony. The driver of the vehicle is said to have alerted his family members via a text message that the Toyota Probox he was driving was stuck at River Enziu, which was flooded and that they were in grave danger. His family members, say that was the last time they heard from him. Mwingi East police boss Paul Munene said authorities are aware of the incident and are waiting for experts from Nairobi to help search for the victims. David Matavo, a relative of driver, called on the government to act fast and help find the four as their efforts have borne no fruit. "Losing four people mysteriously is a big thing, we are really traumatised," said Matavo. Volunteers who have been helping the families search for the victims say they have been able to identify something that appears to be a vehicle at the bottom of the river but there is nothing much they can do as they are not diving experts. John Musyoki, one of the volunteers, called on the government to send more experienced divers with modern equipment at the scene. The ongoing heavy rains in Kitui has claimed more than 20 lives and caused massive destruction.
