Kenyan actress and model Joyce Maina and her family are struggling to come to terms with the disappearance of their father 12 days ago. Fifty four-year-old James Maina Muikia disappeared without a trace on April 21 and his phone has been switched off. Police last traced his phone along the Embu - Mwea road. His last phone call was to his wife the day he disappeared when he informed her that he will be home that evening. The family suspect he was abducted when he went to his farm in Embu because his vehicle has also not been found. There has been no ransom demands and searches in police stations, hospitals and morgues have been fruitless. On Tuesday Joyce sent an appeal on social media asking Kenyans to help them trace her father. "Hey guys. So I know I haven't been 100% myself this past week and it's because my dad has been missing since April, 21 2018. We tried to stay positive and deal with this quietly but we need your help. Please share the poster above and the car and any information you can share will be highly appreciated," she wrote. Hey guys.
