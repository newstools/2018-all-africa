President Yoweri Museveni told a Labour Day gathering that he and his National Resistance Movement party make sacrifices to serve Ugandans. "You cannot lecture me about working for Ugandans, I and the NRM are working for low pay; why don't we go on strike?" he said. But Ssemujju Ibrahim Nganda, opposition chief whip, says the president abuses taxpayers' money by allocating "donations" to his own State House budget.
