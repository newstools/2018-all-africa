Police had to hold off an angry crowd as they cut through a concrete slab to retrieve the body of a man who was kidnapped, killed, and dumped in a pit-latrine. Abel Katende's decomposing body, which had been chopped to pieces, was retrieved by police and fire brigade staff. Police say Katende's wife and children confessed to the crime.
