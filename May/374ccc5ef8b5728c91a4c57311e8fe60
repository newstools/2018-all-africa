A Somali official says more than 10 people were killed and several wounded in a deadly suicide attack at a busy market in Wanlaweyn town, about 90Km west of Mogadishu. Confirming the incident, Abdifitah Hajji Abdulle, the deputy governor of Lower Shabelle region in charge of the finance said a bomber detonated himself at the market. Abdulle added that the bomber targeted a marketplace in Wanlaweyn, where Khat (narcotic leaves) is sold, killing civilians, including women. There is no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast but the Somalia-based al-Shabab has carried out similar attacks in the region. Wanlaweyn lies on the outskirts of Balidogle airbase in Somalia's southern Lower Shabelle region, where the U.S. special forces operate a major base.
