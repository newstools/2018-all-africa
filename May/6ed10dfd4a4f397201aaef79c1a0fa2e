Nairobians are in a celebratory mood following reports that the water levels at Ndakaini Dam has increased. Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company acting managing director Nahashon Muguna confirmed on Monday that the water levels at the dam had increased following heavy rains in the Aberderes range last week. The confirmation came days after Nairobians online questioned why every part of the country was experiencing floods apart from Ndakaini dam. Mr Muguna told Standard newspaper that the dam received 8.580 cubic metres per second on Saturday, adding that the dam currently has 25.866 million cubic metres of water. "Heavy rains come towards end of months April and early May and we hope the facility will harvest to the maximum," he added. Nairobians welcomed the news but urged that more be done to ensure all rain water in the Aberdares region is harvested. Ndakaini water levels rise after huge public outcry! - Constant Cap (@ConstantCap) April 29, 2018 So miraculously, the water levels at Ndakaini have risen - alittle bit. Looks like it's not the rain that raises the level of water; but our voices.#RaiseYourVoice#RaiseTheWaterLevels https://t.co/ALrUmxIZ6W - Caroline Mutoko (@CarolineMutoko) April 29, 2018 If we didnt make noise, Ndakaini Dam would still be supposedly 'empty'. If we didnt make noise, Kenya Power would still be overcharging us with inflated Bills. Making Noise can make a difference. - Captain Ozwald (❤️) (@VinieO) April 30, 2018 So miraculously, the water levels at Ndakaini have started rising after public noise So now rain water is being controlled by cartels. Some people will never see heaven. - Wambui Ndungu (@Loisemuthoni39) April 30, 2018 Let me ask, how can water levels at Ndakaini dam in a deja vu decide to rise after an outcry? Maybe someone sealed the leaking parts of the dam, we many never know. - Kamau Muthoni (@JOHNMUTHONI1) April 30, 2018 Looks like the Ndakaini dam water thief has "released the dam water" like Pharaoh did with the Israelites. Kenya is a special nation on earth... .. - Codi (@codida) April 30, 2018 But Nairobians mnapenda kubebwa wana Sana.. But pia nyinyi thinking yenu ni wanting. Who told you maji yote yenye huwa mnakunywa hutoka Ndakaini tu? Mnajua Kuna sasumua dam? Endeleeni na water rationing juu ya dam moja tu. Pia ile base huwa kikuyu. pic.twitter.com/GjCHbvy5mN - 🇰🇪Iron Lady, Nyakinyua ya Gatanga🇰🇪 (@2njerii) April 30, 2018
