Jubbaland troops backed by Kenyan defence forces [KDF] were reported to have begun a massive military movement on the outskirts of Dhobley town, near Kenyan border. Local residents say they saw KDF helicopters flying over the Al-Shabab-held areas located outside the town as part of the ongoing military drills by the allied forces. The move came after Jubbaland has recently announced a fresh offensive aimed at flushing out Al Shabaab militants from the entire regions under its control. On Tuesday, Ahmed Abdullahi Haybe, a security official in Dhobley town said the locals backed by Jubbaland forces clashed Al-Shabab fighters over livestock tax dispute.
