The 2018 Standard Bank Jazz Festival is kicking off soon with a line-up of leading musicians poised to make it an unforgettable 31st addition at the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown. Taking place from 28 June until 7 July, the programme will celebrate great jazz legacies with a league of world-class musicians, reimagining them with a youthful verve. SOME OF THE PERFORMERS WILL INCLUDE: Thandi Ntuli, DJ Kenzhero, Percy Mabandu, Aaron Goldberg, Afrika Mkhize, Zenzi Makeba Lee, Nduduzo Makhathini, Andile Yenana's sextet Umnqgonqgo Wabantu and Amanda Tiffin. PRO HELVETIA WILL BE CELEBRATING 20 YEARS IN SA AT THE FESTIVAL: Northern Europe has been a leading region in jazz innovation for years. South African jazz has shared in that glory thanks to partnerships and investments made by organizations like the Swiss state arts funding organization Pro Helvetia, which will celebrate a 20-year presence in SA. In recognition of this lengthy role in support of the collaboration between the artists of South Africa and Switzerland, 12 Swiss musicians perform in Grahamstown this year over the course of the festival, sometimes offering their original music and at other times collaborating with South African musicians. TICKETS: The road to Jazztown in Grahamstown is now open. All arts and Jazz lovers can get their tickets when they go on sale from 7 May 2018. Source: Supplied
