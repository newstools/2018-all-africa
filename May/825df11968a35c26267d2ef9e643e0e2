A Lagos-based lawyer, Toluwani Adebiyi, has urged Nigerians affected with the problem of estimated bills to insist on getting a prepaid meter, as the only means of escape from the estimated billing of power Distribution Companies (DISCOs). Adebiyi stated this at a symposium held in Lagos with the topic 'How to achieve stable electricity', organized by Coalition for Affordable and Regular Electricity (CARE). He said: "With prepaid meter, you can manage your electricity usage. The government knows what to do to give citizens stable and affordable power but they are not doing it. I urge affected citizens to make a formal complaint and if they are not attended to, should go to court to enforce their right.
