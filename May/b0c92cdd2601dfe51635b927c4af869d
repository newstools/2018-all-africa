Hollywood actress Lupita Nyong'o has commenced plans for the development of an ultra-modern arts and culture Centre in Kisumu. Over the weekend, she flew to the lakeside city accompanied with esteemed Sir David Frank Adjaye, a Ghanaian-British architect who was the lead designer of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC. Mr Adjaye and Lupita met with former prime minister Raila Odinga who expressed his support for the arts centre. Lupita's visit follows an invitation extended by her parents Governor Anyang' Nyong'o, and mother Dorothy. She visited several cultural sites and arts facilities in the county such as Kanyakwar Cultural Centre, Goan Institute, Kisumu Museum and Kisumu Social Hall. She also met local musicians and artists including Suzanna Owiyo, Nina Ogot and Winyo, comedians Felix Odiwuor alias Jalang'o and Eric Omondi. Film maker Mr Andrew White, film producer Albert Wandago and graphic artist Kwame Nyong'o were also present. Lupita expressed gratitude to the artistes for their open deliberations on the upcoming art centre. "Artistes should master their art and promote high quality. Kisumu County is so rich in talent and I am impressed by the potential," she said. Prof Nyong'o promised to invite artistes to join the Kisumu County Economic and Social Council that will bridge relationships between the government and private sector. "The establishment of a fully equipped ultra-modern art center to address the current needs of artistes in Kisumu will greatly promote the arts, culture, livelihood and tourism in Kisumu County," said Prof Nyong'o.
