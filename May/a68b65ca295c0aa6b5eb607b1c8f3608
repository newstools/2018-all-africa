Johannesburg â€” HUAWEI Marine's implementation of the Pakistan and East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE) has reached a milestone with the testment to the project delivery capabilities. The project, according to the company, is part of its company's commitment to provide efficient, high-quality network solutions for customers. The submarine cable system will connect Pakistan, Djibouti, Kenya, Egypt, and other countries along the Red Sea with a total system length of 8 800km. The project, signed in November last year, is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2019. Huawei Marine is working with its long-term partner, EGS Ltd, to conduct a hydrographic and geophysical survey of the seabed along the planned cable route. EGS' specialized survey vessel the RV Ridley Thomas, has arrived in the region to commence offshore survey operations. Zhang Hongxiang, Project Director for Huawei Marine said: "Our 200G WDM technology that will be deployed in the PEACE cable system will support the rapid development of the East African regional economy and facilitate connectivity between Asia, Africa and Europe." Chris Welsh, Chief Executive Officer of EGS Survey Group, hailed the enhanced partnership with Huawei Marine. EGS brings more than 25 years of extensive cable route survey experience and adheres to the highest professional standards. "We are delighted to contribute to the construction of the new information highway," Welsh said.
