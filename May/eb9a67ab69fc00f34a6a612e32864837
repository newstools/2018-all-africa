Renamo has named Ossufo Momade as its interim leader after Afonso Dhlakama, who had headed the party for almost four decades, died unexpectedly. Ossufo Momade is a former secretary-general of Renamo, member of parliament since 1999, and a general in Renamo's army. Dhlakama's death throws into uncertainty both the negotiations with President Filipe Nyusi and planning for the 2019 presidential election.
