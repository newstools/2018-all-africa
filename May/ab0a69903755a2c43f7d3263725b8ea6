South African band Freshlyground put on a captivating performance at the Harare International Festival of the Arts, as they wrapped up the festival. The group made a return to HIFA after they were deported in 2014 by the former government following the release of their Chicken to Change song, which mocked the ousted leader. And just to spice things up, Freshlyground sang the "controversial" song.
