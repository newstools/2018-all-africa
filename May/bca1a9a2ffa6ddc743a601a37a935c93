Taking issue with an opinion piece by Alon Liel, a former ambassador of Israel to South Africa, current ambassador Lior Keinan reponds. I was surprised to read Mr Alon Liel's article, "Israel: to be ashamed or not to be ashamed". Liel's articles normally keep to a professional tone, but this article seems lacking. A few key pieces of information were left out of the article - I wonder if purposely or is it just, for lack of a better term, sloppy? First, the "full disclosure" is anything but. The article mentioned that Liel has filled the roles of director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, and for Ambassador of Israel to South Africa. That only covers past positions, without mention of his present job. In my mind, it is critical for your readers to know the full picture and actually receive full disclosure. Liel is currently a board member of a few extreme left organisations that receive foreign donations and among other things - criticise Israel. In other words, this article was not written by a retired diplomat, but as someone who criticises Israel as part of his daily job. Relevant or not - you decide. But full disclosure should be just...
