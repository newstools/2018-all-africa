Abuja â€” The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) says its Alpha Jet has killed scores of Boko Haram terrorists in an aerial bombardment while providing a close air support to ground troops of the Nigerian Army at Koleram, Borno State. In a statement yesterday in Abuja by Air Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya, the force said the successful shelling followed a distress call from the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 8 Division of the Nigerian Army. Adesanya noted that the crew of a Nigerien Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft established contact with the ground troops by guiding the Alpha aircraft to the major source of firework from the terrorists, which was seen coming from a particular settlement. The statement reads in part: "A Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet yesterday neutralised scores of Boko Haram terrorists while providing Close Air Support (CAS) to ground troops. "The General Officer Commanding (GOC) therefore requested for support from the NAF, sequel to which the Alpha aircraft was immediately scrambled to provide CAS. On arrival at the location, there were exchanges of fire between Boko Haram terrorists and our ground forces. "Consequently, the NAF Alpha jet engaged the target with rockets and cannons, thus neutralising the Boko Haram terrorists and destroying their weapons. "The Air Task Force will continue to conduct missions, on request, in support of the efforts of our troops in the counter-insurgency operations in the North East."
