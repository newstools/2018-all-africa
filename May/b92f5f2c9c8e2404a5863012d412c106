The Amnesty International said Human Rights are at risk because of the recent trend of intimidating journalists and crack down on peaceful protests. The Director of Amnesty International Nigeria, Osai Ojigho made this known in a statement yesterday in commemoration of the World Press Freedom Day. He criticized the intimidation and harassment of journalists and bloggers, as well as violent crackdowns on peaceful protest. He said this shows the determination of the authorities to suppress the rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in Nigeria. Amnesty called on Nigerian authorities to desist from the disturbing patterns of using security agencies to silence dissenting voices. He said, "Many Nigerians are becoming increasingly afraid of exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly."
