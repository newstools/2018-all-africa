Popular Tanzanian video vixen and singer Amber Lulu, has landed a huge endorsement deal from a condom manufacturing company. Lulu, known for her semi nude posts on her social media accounts, penned a long term deal with the condom company whose identity is yet to be made public. It has been reported that in the deal, Lulu, a one-time girlfriend to Kenyan rapper CMB Prezzo, will be the brand ambassador of the product which will display her image on its package. Lulu said she was happy to get the deal adding that the terms are very good and will earn her big money. "Ninamshukuru Mungu kwa sababu ya nafasi hii, nimetia sahihi mkataba mzuri na kampuni moja ya kutengenza kondomu kama balozi wao. Ni mkataba uliona pesa nyingi na ni hatua kubwa kwangu na mashabiki wangu," she said. Prezzo's relationship with Amber picked off just months after he split with socialite Michelle Yola. However, the romance was short-lived after the controversial rapper Prezzo reportedly dumped Lulu and picked on another Kenyan beau.
