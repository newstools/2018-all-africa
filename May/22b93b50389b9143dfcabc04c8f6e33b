Over 150 people from Gitogoto village, Tharaka-Nithi County, have been affected by landslides. The affected families have now camped at the neighbouring Gitogoto Primary School. Tharaka-Nithi County Commissioner Muzne Abdullatif said a number of livestock had been buried alive and houses brought down by mud. "Our people have lost property and to avoid deaths, those at risk will be moved to safer places," said Ms Abdullatif. She said with the ongoing heavy rains, more landslides were likely to occur because huge cracks had started developing on the land. CAMPS She said the government would provide those in camps with food and other basic amenities. "We have received 200 bags of rice and we are set to receive maize and other energy foods for the children and cooking oil," she said. The administrator asked county government, area Member of Parliament and other leaders to support to the affected families. VICTIMS Kenya Red Cross Society county representative, Jerusha Nyaga said the organisation would provide the affected people with tents and bedding. Mr Gikombe Murithi, one of the victims, said his cows and houses were on Saturday covered by mud.
