The fifth season of kykNET's popular talk show, Republiek van Zoid Afrika kicked off on Thursday night. Host Karen Zoid was joined by local beauty Minki van der Westhuizen and Afrikaans singer Jo Black. As with previous seasons Karen ends the show by doing a duet with one of her guests. On Thursday night's episode viewers were treated to not one but two songs. Karen opened the show with Johannes Kerkorrel's Hoe Ek Voel and wrapped things up with a moving rendition of Skepe. Both songs were made available in Apple's South African iTunes store and immediately skyrocketed to the number one and two positions. "The reaction has been overwhelming and it took me hours last night to read through all the messages I received," Karen said of the positive response the show received since airing. She added: "Thank you to all the viewers and residents of the Republiek van Zoid Afrika. Here we go again!" Next week's guests include Prime Circle's Ross, rugby player Eben Etzebeth and actress Quanita Adams. Die Republiek van Zoid Afrika airs Thursdays at 20:00 on kykNET (DStv 144). Source: Channel24
