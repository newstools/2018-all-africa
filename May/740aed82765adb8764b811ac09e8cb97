Kenyan model Mabel Mbaka has become the envy of many new mothers after being gifted a top of the range luxury car by her husband following the birth of her first child. Mabel, whose wedding to Congolese tycoon Tony Muabinga was held in Paris in July 2017, gave birth to their first born recently. She then took to Instagram to flaunt her gifts that featured designer bags and colognes along with an Audi S.

Her bridal shower, which preceded her wedding in Paris, took place in a yacht in Barcelona, Spain. Early this year, she pulled a lavish pink themed baby shower in her Nairobi home. Mabel, who is known for her love for designer bags, shoes and perfumes, recently flaunted her babymoon trip to Dubai but her brand new vehicle tops it all.
