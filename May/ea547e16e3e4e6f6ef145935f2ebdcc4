Calabar â€” Authorities of Pandrillus Drill Sanctuary in Calabar, owners of Afi mountain wildlife sanctuary in Buanchor, Boki LGA, of Cross River State, have confirmed that 28 animals, including chimpanzees and gorillas escaped from the facility over a week ago and roamed freely in the nearby surrounding communities. An official who spoke to Daily Trust on phone but did not want her identity disclosed said the incident happened because a large tree fell and destroyed part of the sanctuary, making it possible for the animals to escape. The official, who spoke after one of the chimpanzees was caught by a forest guide and farmer, John Ekpang in the forest of Konyiachi, a farming area of Bitiah Irruan village in Boki LGA, said as soon as the incident happened at about 2:00a.m. they deployed all expertise to track the animals. She said their efforts yielded good results as their forest experts and animal guardians recover all except one female chimpanzee. "As a result of this, we have sent word round all the surrounding communities about what happened, appealing that they should not attack her if found, assuring that she, too, would not attack. We had pledged good reward to encourage them to help secure her. "However, upon getting the news from the villagers that she was found, we moved there immediately, appreciated the community for taking such good care of her. And we returned her to the sanctuary on Saturday; after a week," the official explained. When she was caught, forest guide and farmer Ekpang said it was not violent but friendly, so he played along with it and it followed him to the village centre where it attracted the entire community. Reacting, country director of World Conservative Society, an organisation responsible for conservation of rare animals, Mr Andrew Dunn, said, "The chimp was definitely an escaped animal from Pandrillus sanctuary in Buanchor. She became so used to humans. It was clearly not a wild chimpanzee."
