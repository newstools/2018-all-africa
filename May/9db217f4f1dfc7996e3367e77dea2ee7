Musician and Starehe MP Charles 'Jaguar' Njagua and nemesis Prezzo over the weekend buried the hatchet to end Kenya's longest running celebrity beef. Only recently, Jaguar had derisively referred to Prezzo as "a socialite who was not worth beefing with". The two have however agreed to work together to chat way forward for Kenya's entertainment industry. Jaguar announced the reconciliation on Sunday evening in what the two described as "rising above their differences". "A lot was said over the years, but we have decided to rise above our differences and focus on the betterment of our entertainment industry," Jaguar tweeted. Met up with my colleague and brother CMB @AMB_Prezzo For long, we chose to walk on different paths despite chasing the same dream. A lot was said over the years, but we have decided to rise above our differences and focus on the betterment of our entertainment industry. pic.twitter.com/qczy9WWg2j - Hon.
