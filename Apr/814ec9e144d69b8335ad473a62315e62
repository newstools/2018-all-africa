Abuja â€” Wife of the Senate President, Toyin Ojora Saraki, has called for an urgent transformation to cancer treatment across the country. Making this call yesterday in Abuja at the launch of the cancer assessment report in Nigeria hosted by the Wellbeing Foundation Africa (WBFA), Saraki stressed the need for citizens to stop high risk behaviours, training them to be able to detect cancer at the early stage when it is most cost effective to treat. She said the launched report would provide all stakeholders with evidence for efficient frontline actions to prevent, detect, and treat cancer across Nigeria. She maintained that the report would allow stakeholders harness their wealth of knowledge and key into the recently announced government policy for prompt actions across the nation. She said: "We must never doubt the power of small group of people united with a common purpose and our purpose is to prevent cancer, detect cancer, and provide infrastructure to be able to respond to the needs of our people in relation to all types of cancer." She added: "We can also teach our people, and intensify citizens engagement in reducing high risk behaviours, to be best positioned to detect cancers at an early stage when they are most successful and cost effective to treat". While receiving the report on behalf of the Federal Government, the Minister of State for Health, Osagie Ehanire, said the report findings and stakeholders meeting aligned with government plans to strengthen the training of cancer related health workers, improving infrastructure and service delivery for cancer prevention, treatment and palliative care.
