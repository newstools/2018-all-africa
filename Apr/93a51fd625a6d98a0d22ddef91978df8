The World Cup song, Colours, was composed by U.S. pop singer Jason Derulo. Artists from all over the world were invited to add their local flavour and represent their regions, creating a pool of songs that will expose audiences to global diversity. South African rapper Cassper Nyovest, Ethiopia's Sami Dan, Mozambique's Lizha James, Uganda's Ykee Benda, Tanzania's Diamond Platnumz and Nahreel also produced songs, which will depict the colours and styles of their countries and challenge negative international stereotypes of Africa.
