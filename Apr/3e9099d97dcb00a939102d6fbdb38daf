The incident reportedly happened during a (introduction) dowry ceremony of musician Catherine Kusasira. According to Sqoop, an assault report implicating Chameleon has been lodged by Sseguya with the police. "He beat me up claiming I'm the one responsible of his low rankings in music," the journalist explained. DENIED ACCUSATIONS "These are kicks of a dying horse. Chameleon was looking for ways of making news and indeed he made it, but on the contrary it should be music doing the talking for him," he added. Chameleon has however denied the accusations but admitted to having a not so pleasant discussion with the complainant whom he described as a 'friend'. "He (Sseguya) is my friend. We've come from far with him. I just approached him and told him to stop talking ill about me. When my wife gave birth from America, he talked. When my wife left home (me), he still talked, but now that you've decided to go to court, it's fine. God will judge us," the singer explained. Chameleon's controversies and and run in with family members, colleagues, politicians, promoters and now journalists are well documented.
