Motorists were on Sunday night left stranded after flash floods cut off Malaba-Kampala highway at Agro Bridge, 4 kilometres from the border. The motorists, mainly drivers of cargo trucks, were denied entry and exit to Malaba town following a heavy down pour, which started at 9pm and lasted for three hours. "The heavy down pour forced the waters to overlap the bridge and the culverts. It's has brought everything to standstill because trucks, taxis and padestrians are stranded," Mr Charles Ekisa, a village chairperson of Asinge A, in Malaba town council, said. Mr Ekisa, said the running water swept off one person, who was riding a bicycle heading to Malaba town but they managed to rescue him. "But he was rescued by people, who were equally trying to cross the flooded section of the road," he said. Mr Joseph Njoroge, a cargo truck driver, who was enroute to Democratic Republic of Congo, said the floods affected his journey. "This calamity has kept me here for hours now yet am going very far. It has terribly affected me," he said. For the pedestrians, who wanted to be helped to cross over with their luggage, they parted with Shs 10,000.
