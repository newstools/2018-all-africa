Lyrical Engineer, Koko Pee who recently turned down the stage he shared with music heavyweights like Wizkid, Davido, Tekno and Tiwa at the just completed WARRI MEGA FIESTA, has confessed his love for controversial big brother reality show housemate,CeeC. This was gathered in a brief interview with the music act, afterward he spoke on his future and other trending topics. According to him, he would love to have been in the Big Brother house and fit into the shoes of Tobi, who has been criticised for not leaving or lashing out at Ceec for her complains , lies and misbehavior in the on going Big Brother contest . Koko Pee said, "This could just be a game plan for Ceec and strategy for Tobi, to help prolong their stay in the show. Although many perceive CeeC to be a very skilled liar, I just see her as a lawyer/ barrister who is keeping fit in the house by creating scenes and using evidences at her disposal even if most of which were lies". He added that "Ceec is a replica of how every Nigerian mother expects their daughter to be outside, as we all know that Nigerian mothers expect all their daughters to have "Virgin Mary" profile. Every mother wish her daughter hide their dirty linen in public and CeeC is doing that very well". He concluded that there's always fault in everyone but as long as we pick on the person's strength then we are going to be happy. "I mean she's a 25-year virgin in this current generation, how many are they? This is a rare feat. If truly she is, then she must be very principled in this social media age, when a girl has over 5000 male friends looking to devour her. I wish her all the best" he said. Koko Pee is also set to launch his own comic series which will feature heavyweights in the entertainment industry.
