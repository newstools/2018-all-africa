Kenya put up a good fight on Saturday April 14 to earn themselves a convincing 4-0 victory against hosts Burundi in the opening match of the 2018 CECAFA U-17 Challenge Cup played at the Umuco Stadium in Muyinga, about 200-Kilomtres of the capital, Bujumbura. Christopher Raila put Kenya into an early lead in the 13th minute before Nicholas Omondi netted the second one just three minutes later to put the margin at 2-0. Burundi kept improving tactfully and playing entertaining passes that yielded no results till the end of first half. The second half saw Isaiah Abwal netting twice in the 54th and 80th minutes to deny Burundi any chances in their Group A' opener. The match was watched by the First Vice President of Burundi, Gaston Sindimwo, CECAFA President, Dr. Gafar Mutasim, among several other dignitaries. In a post-match interview, Burundi head coach Vivier Bahati said his boys had the potential of improving in the next fixture against Somalia on Tuesday. "We played well but never utilized our finishing chances well. I am however optimistic of a victory from my next game", he said. The other Group A match between Sudan and Zanzibar was called off after nine players of the latter were declared ineligible. On Sunday, Uganda and Tanzania played to a one-all draw at the same venue in Muyinga in Group B. Ethiopia edged Somalia 3-1 in the other Group B match in Ngozi but Ethopia was declared losers for fielding three ineligible players. Somalia has thus been awarded a 3-0 win. CECAFA Secretary General Nicholas Musonye said the organizing committee is expected to take a decision on Zanzibar and Ethiopia as soon as possible.
