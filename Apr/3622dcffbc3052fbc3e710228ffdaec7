At least 16 families in Nakuru County's Naivasha town have moved to safety after some of their crops sank and were swallowed into a two-kilometre fault line that has cut across a number of farms. The crack is reportedly similar to the one that cut across sections of Mai Mahiu weeks ago. Kenya's Rift Valley is slowly splitting, geologists have said, after massive Earth movements left deep fissures in Narok County.
