Geiger International has announced that it won't cancel a contract to dualise the Beitbridge-Chirundu highway. President Mnangagwa announced during a visit to China that the Austrian contractor's tender to carry out one of the biggest road projects in the country since independence had been canceled because the firm was failing to deliver on time.
