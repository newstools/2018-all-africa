The first KenyaBuzz movie week in Kenya came to an end on Friday evening with pomp and colour during the grand opening of Anga Diamond Cinema at Diamond Plaza II. It was a great evening of sampling food, cocktails, mingling and of course, a movie to watch with great gifts on offer thereafter. The event, which was sponsored by among others Ciroc Kenya and Visa, ran from March 16 to 13 May and comprised of eight theme nights at seven cinemas across Nairobi. The partnership with KenyaBuzz was designed to drive traffic into select theatres while enriching the experience for the movie goers. KenyaBuzz's founder Alix Grubel said the week-long showcase would act as a platform for the enrichment of the local social scene. "We at KenyaBuzz love everything to do with movies, and we would love to see more people getting out to enjoy the big screen. It is our belief that this partnership will fuel the growth of the industry to the benefit of everyone involved," she said. On the other hand, Nation Media Group Acting CEO Mr Stephen Gitagama said: "Nation Media Group is proud to launch the Movie Week Festival in all theatres across Nairobi through our ticketing platform, KenyaBuzz." He expressed hope that the partnership for the festival, which is a first of its kind in the market, will go a long way to embed a culture of movie going bringing out the spirit of magical entertainment. The week-long film festival attracted over 3,000 people who efficiently buy a ticket through KenyaBuzz and paid via Visa at their convenience.
