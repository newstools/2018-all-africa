Congolese musician Koffi Olomide will likely not visit Kenya this week to perform at the Devolution Conference. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has announced that the expected entertainment highlight of the conference hangs on the balance over a visa hitch . "I have been in touch with his promoters and they tell me he has challenges in processing a Visa because of what happened the other time he was here," Oparanya said on Monday: "I hope he eventually comes here but at this moment it is unlikely." Oparanya also clarified that his administration will not spend a coin to host the 61-year-old musician. The county government was accused of misplaced priorities in the wake of reports that it intended to splash in excess of Sh20 million to host the musician. "We will only provide the lights at the venue of his night performances in the county," Oparanya said. The lingala maestro recently announced via social media that he will perform at the conference in Kakamega this week. However, ghosts from the past seem to be haunting the Selfie singer. His last visit to Kenya in 2016 ended in a dramatic deportation after he was filmed kicking one of his dancers at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.
