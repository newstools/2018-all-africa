RESPONSIBILITY The highlight of the State House concert is expected to be Eregi Teachers' Training College's cultural dance, "Makunda". The dance is about a young man who demands land from his father but ends up squandering the money he got after selling the property. However, his sister takes him to a rehabilitation centre, which moulds him into a responsible person. The dance produced the best soloist, female and dancers as well as best costume and decor. It also produced most original and best choreographed dance. Other groups listed for the State concert are St Anne's ECD (solo verse), Thika School for the Visually Impaired (cultural dance), Liganwa Primary School (cultural dance) and Kenyatta University with a narrative.
