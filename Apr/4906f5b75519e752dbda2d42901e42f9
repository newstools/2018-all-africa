Most Namibians won't be in Russia for the upcoming Fifa World Cup, but Coca-Cola Namibia intend to ensure that they get to share in the experience at home. The beverage manufacturer, a long-time partner of Fifa, kicked off its World Cup promotion in Windhoek on Friday, announcing several exciting activation plans and prizes for consumers. "The aim of the promotion is to give Namibians a taste of the World Cup. As we celebrate the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia, we start with a World Cup promotion that will give an opportunity to our citizens to win fabulous prizes. Namibia is a country where Coca-Cola promotions are embraced and we look forward to another successful event," said Coca-Cola Namibia sales and marketing director Pottie de Bruyn. The prizes include television sets, home theatre systems and airtime, while there will also be live screenings of matches at yet to be disclosed locations around Windhoek to go with sporadic mall activations. The promotion runs from 1 May to 31 July, sandwiching the Fifa World Cup finals which take place between 14 June and 15 July. Consumers are being asked to buy any of Coca-Cola's participating products namely Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite with a lime green cap and send the unique code inside the cap to 26536. "The promotion is a way of celebrating the World Cup and saying thank you to our loyal consumers. They are not only getting refreshed, they are also earning something much more which we hope will bring a smile to their faces and help make their lives better in some way," said the bottling company's brand manager Tamar Mbalo.
