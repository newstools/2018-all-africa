Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi has finally opened up on the epic dance floor battle with a love rival that saw him win over a girl who later became his better half. The seasoned politician narrated his ordeal during an appearance on the weekly Churchill Show on NTV. "I met my wife (Priscilla) on the dance floor, but it wasn't easy because she had come with another man," Murungi explained to an excited audience. "It seems in the end I impressed her with my dancing skills because I won her over." Governor Murungi's three-decade political career has seen him serve as a Member of Parliament, Senator and Governor. What is however never known is that he joined politics by accident. "I wanted to bring change and better the lives of Kenyans by informing them of their rights. So I joined Jaramogi Oginga's Ford-Kenya party back then." "Soon I was asked to contest for the Parliamentary seat in my area becaise there was nobody. That's how my journey started." "My hobbies include sleeping. I love resting. I also like it when my company is a happy one. Like you and these people." The governor was later joined on stage by Priscilla for a couple dance.
