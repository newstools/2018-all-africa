The South African Women's Sevens team has suffered another big loss at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia, going down 41- 0 to New Zealand on Friday. South Africa had gone down 29-0 to Canada in their first match of the tournament earlier in the day, and this loss against the Kiwis means that they will not progress through to the semi-finals in what is the first ever Women's Sevens tournament at the Commonwealth Games. While the experience of playing on the big stage will surely be beneficial in the long run, coach Paul Delport's side has confirmed that they still have a long way to go. The result was never in doubt as New Zealand raced to a 22-0 lead by half-time. By the time they were done, the Kiwis had run in a total of seven tries as South Africa had no answer to wave after wave of attack. South Africa will play Kenya in their final pool game on Saturday morning. Source: Sport24
