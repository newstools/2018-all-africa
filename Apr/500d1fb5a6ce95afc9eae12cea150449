Rwanda women's beach volleyball team defeated Singapore 2-0 yesterday to advance to the quarterfinals of the ongoing XXI Commonwealth Games in Australia. Denise Mutatsimpundu and Charlotte Nzayisenga cruised to a 21-11 victory in the first set but Singapore proved they were not walkovers when they gave Rwanda a run for their money in the second set. The crucial victory for coach Christophe Mudahinyuka's team was all they needed to survive an early exit from the showpiece on the Gold Coast after losing their first two group games to New Zealand and Vanuatu. In an interview with Times Sport from Australia, Mudahinyuka called for more determination from his team ahead of the next hurdle. "The first two defeats taught us to be more ruthless with our chances and thanks to that, the ladies bounced back to beat Singapore and advance to the last eight," Mudahinyuka said. He added, "Now we are waiting to know who we will face in quarterfinals, but, we are ready to face any opponent with confidence and determination. Our target is to reach the semifinals." The Rwandan duo of Mutatsimpundu and Nzayisenga booked their ticket to the XXI Commonwealth Games after beating Nigeria in the final of African Championships in Sierra Leone last October. Rwanda qualified for quarterfinals as second runners-up in Group C, behind group leaders New Zealand and first runners-up Vanuatu. Yesterday Rwanda 2-0 Singapore
