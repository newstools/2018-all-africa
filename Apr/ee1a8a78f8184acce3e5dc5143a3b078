The Malaria Summit, London, saw 14 Heads of State and Government, Bill Gates, scientists and private sector and international organisations making significant commitments that will catalyse progress towards beating malaria at a time when efforts to end the preventable disease have stalled. High level political commitments to beat malaria were made by Heads of State and Government, and Ministers from 19 Commonwealth countries. Commitments exceeded expectations by £200m. The Summit featured collective commitments worth over £2.9bn ($4.1bn) from governments, the private sector, philanthropists and International Organisations. The Summit also featured a call to action - led by Heads of Commonwealth State and Government, HRH The Prince of Wales and Bill Gates – urging the Commonwealth leaders meeting tomorrow to commit to halving malaria within five years.  That commitment would prevent 350 million cases of the disease in the next five years and save 650,000 lives across Commonwealth countries.
