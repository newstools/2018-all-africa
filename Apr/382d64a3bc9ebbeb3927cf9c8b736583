LIVE: SA v Australia - 4th Test, Day 3 South Africa, 2-1 up in the series in this the final Test, are looking to beat Australia in a home series for the first time since re-admission. The lanky 33-year-old left the field after two balls of his 13th over, and Cricket South Africa confirmed that it was the same side strain that he had picked up in last year's series against Bangladesh. The good news from a South African perspective was that Morkel returned to the field 15 minutes before lunch, with world from the Proteas camp suggesting that he would "push on".
