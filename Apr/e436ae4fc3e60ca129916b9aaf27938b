After raising a petition against the demolition of Olaiya House, also known as Ilojo Bar and Casa do Fernandez, on Tinubu Square in Lagos, Legacy, a non-governmental organization involved in protecting and raising awareness of historical buildings is planning to address issues concerning protection, preservation of architectural heritage. The demolition of the national monument aroused great public concern about the condition and future of our built heritage. It emphasised the urgent need to bring together representatives from the Federal and State governments and owners and custodians of historic building and monuments and other stakeholders to have a dialogue over the issues and challenges over their protection and preservation. The workshop in collaboration with the Goethe Institut will draw institutions such as the National Commission for Monuments and Museums (NCMM) and the Lagos State Ministry for Arts, Culture and Tourism, along with other professionals. Stakeholders will examine the existing laws and policies protecting historic buildings and monuments, the roles and responsibilities and major concerns and challenges. The workshop will include presentations on the existing legal position, and be an opportunity to learn from case studies, which reflect both the failures and successes in protecting our built heritage. Legacy will use the opportunity of the workshop to identify changes required in the way in which the management of our built heritage is conducted, encourage the various stakeholders to adopt clearer roles and responsibilities, increase the knowledge and visibility of historic buildings and monuments. A statement jointly issued by Vice President Legacy, Kofo Adeleke and Director, Goethe Institut, Friederike Moschel said, the workshop will promote development of professional skills and capacity building necessary for restoration and preservation is vital, as well as necessary improvements in the funding of historical buildings and sites. It will also create more opportunities for local initiatives based on history and tourism.
