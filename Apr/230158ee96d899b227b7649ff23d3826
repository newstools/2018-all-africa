Forensic investigations in the Department of Health Premier Supra Mahumapelo instituted forensic investigations in the Department of Health in the wake of allegations relating to Mediosa (medical mobile unit) interfacility transfer, including Buthelezi Emergency Medical Services and other procurement related matters raised by the public. The forensic investigators were supposed to have concluded their work by end of March 2018 and have unfortunately not been able to do so because of the on-going strike by NEHAWU members in the Department of Health. The investigators are unable to access critical documents and information which is in the premises of the Department of Health. The Department of Health has had meetings with NEHAWU in a bid to resolve issues which the union has raised. "The sooner issues are resolved between the Department and the union the sooner will the investigators be able to conclude their work." Says the Director General Dr Keneilwe Sebego .
