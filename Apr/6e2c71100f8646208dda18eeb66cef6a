Apparently Diddi, which is short for Edidiong, is famous for working with superstars like Jennifer Lopez and Usher. Some of the other artists that she has performed alongside or choreographed for include Missy Elliott, Ciara, Ludacris, Jason Derulo, Tinashe, Future, and "Big Trouble" from the FOX TV series, Star. She was born in Nigeria and migrated to the U.S. from Akwa Ibom State at age 2. At 15 years (10th grade), she was scouted and signed to her current dance agents, Sindy Schneider and Nefertiti Robinson of 411 South. But since she was unable to secure many dance jobs due to her age, she became a choreographer. She received academic scholarships and grants to Georgia State University In 2010, one-year shy of graduating, she quit school to pursue her passion full-time after she got an offer to tour with the Black Eyed Peas and Ludacris. She was 20 at the time. Edidiong's dance and choreography style tilts towards Afrobeat, R&B/Pop and Hip-Hop realm. Kendra on the other hand was born and raised in the U.S. She is not formally trained but has always had a natural talent for dance, singing, and acting. In 2013, Kendra won Pepsi's "Dance for a Chance" contest and got the opportunity to work with Beyonce's choreographer, Chris Grant, and meet Beyoncé personally. Grant convinced her to move to Los Angeles and purse dance professionally. Since moving to Los Angeles, she has worked and with some of the industries top choreographers. She has also toured and worked for major artistes including P. Diddy and the Bad Boy family, Flo Rida, Tinasha, KeKe Palmer, Paul McCartney, Tamar Braxton, and many more. Beyonce also featured the quotes of award-winning Nigerian author, Chimamanda Adichie, at the ongoing concert on Sunday morning.
