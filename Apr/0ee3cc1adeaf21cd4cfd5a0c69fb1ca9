Kenya's legendary hip hop group Ukoo Flani are back after a decade-long hiatus. The group will make their first public reappearance in the "Concert in the Dark" on Saturday April 28 at the Louis Leakey Auditorium. The group will hit the stage in a dark auditorium with lights out both on the audience and the stage. The Kilio Cha Haki hit makers recently inked a deal with Christian Blind Mission (CBM) Kenya, an organization that works with the disabled. The deal will see the group participate in CBM's activities including a concert dubbed "Concert in the Dark 2018" aimed at raising funds for prevention of childhood blindness. Other headlining performers for the event are Crystal Asige and gospel artist Denno. The concert is a fundraising initiative in partnership with National Council of Persons Living with Disability, Carlson Wagonlit Kenya, OnPoint Media, Proem, and Glow Inc Kenya. The hip-hop group were childhood friends who pioneered Kenyan hip hop that gelled Swahili and Sheng rap. They gave powerful portrayals of colonialism, post-independence betrayals, endemic corruption, police brutality, street life and poverty in the ghetto.
