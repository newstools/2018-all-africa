President Yoweri Museveni has stopped the Uganda Revenue Authority from obtaining customer information from banks. Sources says the president's ruling came after Finance Minister Matia Kasaija sought Cabinet direction on how to proceed with the URA move. The Uganda Bankers Association is to challenge the directive in the Constitutional Court. The URA wrote to all Ugandan banking institutions last month, asking them to release demographic and financial information on all accounts in the years 2016 and 2017.
