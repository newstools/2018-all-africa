Although he did not say when former president Robert Mugabe would appear before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, the Chairperson Temba Mliswa has resolved to summon Mugabe to appear for a hearing over the alleged disappearance of U.S.$15 billion worth of diamonds from Marange diamond fields. The 94-year-old, who was kicked out of power in 2017, has previously been accused of siphoning off the country's diamond profits. Meanwhile, former first lady Grace Mugabe is also being investigated for ivory poaching.
