City socialite Brian Kirumira alias Bryan White hit the Ugandan social scene with a bang and within a few months of him splashing money to whoever could say his name, he was the number one selling being discussed on all local tabloids. It looked like he was going to be stuck in our faces for a very long time until something unexpected happened. He was arrested for attempted murder, an offence that attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment according to Uganda's Penal Code. Right at the time when he was cementing his position in Uganda's social life, White and his bodyguard Thomas Okot were remanded to Luzira Maximum security prisons for attempting to kill his neighbour, Victor Bitwire. The duo were reported to have shot Bitwire on the night of December 13 last year in Munyonyo. IGP Ochola orders audit of guns White and Okot were incarcerated in prison as the case was being heard by court until January 7 when he gained temporary freedom as he was granted Shs20 million cash bail. Ever since then, Bryan White has been in and out of court until this afternoon (March 10) when the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Mr Mike Chibita dismissed the court proceedings against Bryan White. The dismissal of the court proceedings came after Bryan White reconciled with Bitwire on March 9 and he agreed to be compensated and settle things outside court. Upon his release, the socialite was seen outside court with some of the members of his foundation who include artistes and comedians. You may have wondered why Bryan White didn't go with Weasel to London for a show and yet the two are nowadays inseparable. But it was because he did not have a passport at the time. It had been posted in court as one of the conditions for his bail.
