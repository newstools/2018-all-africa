With recent rains, the drought of 2014 to 2017, for most of us, is all but forgotten. But for hydrologists a drought is only over when the whole system is flush. Even then, the operation of the system should ensure that users are optimally protected when the next drought comes round again. The Vaal River System is complex: the Vaal Dam is augmented from upstream dams such as Sterkfontein (in turn fed from the Thukela through the Drakensberg Hydropower Project) and the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) with its two large dams, Katse and Mohale. Currently the Sterkfontein Dam is full, but this is not the case with the Katse and Mohale dams, respectively 66% and only 36% full. This means the system is not flush - there is still space in the LHWP to store 1,000-million cubic meters of water, the equivalent of three Loskop dams. Sophisticated computer models are used to operate complex water systems in order to maximise their effectiveness. It is, however, not necessary to do such an exercise to conclude that upper dams generally should remain as full as possible and for as long as possible. Withdrawal of water should be concentrated on lower dams,...
