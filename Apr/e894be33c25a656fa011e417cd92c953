Bra Hugh was an inspiration to the Jazz community locally and globally, though he never performed on the LIJF stage, we believe we owe him a duty to be celebrated for his long and positively impactful life through his music. Hugh Masekela's spirit lives on through his music which will be with us for a long time."
