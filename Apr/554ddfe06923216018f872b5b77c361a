Rwanda booked their place at the next round after holding Kenya in a barren draw on Saturday in Kigali. The Junior Amavubi advanced on the away goal rule after a 1-1 tie on aggregate. There were very few chances in the match held at the Stade Regional de Kigali, with Rwanda's Lague Byiringiro missing the best scoring opportunities in either half. Kenya's Bogarde Cyitegetse also failed to hit the back of the net in the 70th minute, as the hopes of the Junior Harambee Stars crumbled yet again. "The game was tough but we are happy to qualify for the next round. We didn't play our usual game which is a disappointment, but the team did well to resist pressure from the Kenyans in the latter stages," Rwanda coach Vincent Mashami said after match. Rwanda will face holders Zambia at the next round. Elsewhere in Juba, visiting Uganda beat South Sudan 3-0 to complete a double over the latter and book their place at the penultimate round 8-1 on aggregate. Stephen Mukwala netted a second half brace whilst youngster Allan Okello was the other scorer. Forward Bienvenue Shaka scored six minutes from time to power Burundi past Ethiopia in Ngozi. The former went through 3-0 on aggregate. Seven teams from the qualifiers will join host Niger for the final tournament scheduled for 2-17 February 2019.
