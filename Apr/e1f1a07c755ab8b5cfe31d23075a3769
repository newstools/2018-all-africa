Nashukuru kwa kuwa hapa na mimi, naamini hata mtoto wetu kama anatutizama anafuraha Zaidi," said Diamond. CHEERS His remarks were received with cheers from the audience. In a separate video of the same event shared by Mtanzania Digital, Hamissa returns the favor by also praising Diamond. The host, who followed her to where she was sitting, asked her to name a man in attendance at the event who was best dressed. "Katika angalia angalia yako, kwa usiku huu wa leo ni nani mwanaume ambao ametokelezea kuliko wote ni nani na umefurahia uwepo wake?" asks the host. "Diamond Platinumz," answered Hamisa. Diamond and Hamisa share a son together. This was one of the few times the two have been seen together after news of their secret love affair was revealed by the singer. The affair was the beginning of the end to Diamonds relationship withUgandan socialite Zari Hassan. During a live interview with Tanzania's Cloud FM last year, the Zilizopendwa singer admitted to having an affair with Hamisa and even claimed to have told Zari about it.
