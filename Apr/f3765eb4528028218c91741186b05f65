A new short film titled "Mukanya" based on positive fatherhood in society, courtesy of Conversations With Our Fathers (CWOF) forum was recently launched in Harare. The 22-minute long film, features Stephen Chigorimbo who takes the lead role as Mukanya. The story is based on a man who used to physically abuse his wife and neglect his children whilst spending his money on friends and commercial sex workers. His character is however, transformed after attending a men's forum. He rekindles love with his wife and mentors his son who was also abusing his wife following in his father's footsteps. The film was written by renowned author Ignatious Mabasa and produced by Yvonne Jila, Karen Mukwasi and Siza Mukwedini who are pioneers of the CWOF forum. CWOF is a platform created to engage men and boys through dialogue to fight against gender based violence using films. In an interview Mukwasi said the film is meant to raise awareness on the importance of fatherhood. "With this film we are advocating for fathers and men to play a positive role in creating safe spaces for women and girls through these conversations. "We realised that there are few forums for men where they can discuss positive life matters as compared to women," she said. "Mukanya" will also be screened in areas like Gwanda, Plumtree, Bulawayo and Hwange. "We want to spread this message of engagement to communities in different parts of the country and to the corporate world. "We believe this will open a new dispensation of men that are loving and caring to their families," she said. The film was sponsored by United States Embassy in Zimbabwe. As film makers we have to be part of development to tell stories that our communities can identify.
