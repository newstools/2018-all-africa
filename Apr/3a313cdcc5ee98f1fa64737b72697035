Be warned! The common habit of littering the streets of with sweets wrappers and cigarette butts will now come at a heavy price for Nairobians who are found guilty. In a new directive announced by Nairobi County Environment CEC Larry Wambua, littering the streets will attract a fine of up to Sh5,000 or a six-months jail term. Dumping huge solid wastes on the other hand will attract a Sh100,000 fine that is applicable every time the act is repeated or a one-year jail sentence. Wambua spoke on Saturday during a tree planting campaign at the Michuki Park which was presided over by the Cabinet Secretary for Environment and Forestry Keriako Tobiko. Wambua said the move is aimed at enforcing waste management laws in the city adding that those who fail to show where they have been dumping their waste will also be taken to task to explain the same. TREE PLANTING "We will need to know if you are giving waste to the registered companies. If you fail to show us, it will attract a fine of Sh100,000 or one year in jail," he said. Tobiko, on his part, challenged the private sector to join hands with the government in the plan to increase the country's forest cover. "The Kenya Forest Service has one million seedlings against 25 million that we need to plant during the national tree planting day that will be officiated by the president," Tobiko said. He said the Kenya Defence Forces needs two million seedlings to restore Kibiko, Thogotho, and Ololua forests. The Michuki Park was established in honour of former Environment Minister the late John Michuki for his efforts towards protecting Nairobi River. More than 1,000 trees were planted during the drive with at least 50 million trees expected to be planted in the ongoing national campaign dubbed "Change the Story".
