Pascale Lamche's Winnie , the documentary on South Africa's Mother of the Nation will air on e.tv this weekend. The film made it's TV debut earlier this week on eNCA. e.tv will now broadcast it on Sunday, 15 April at 16:00 and eExtra on OpenView (Channel 105) and DStv (Channel 195) at 21:00. This illuminating work brings fresh perspective and insight into the life of anti-apartheid activist and human rights advocate Nomzamo Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The documentary won a Sundance Award in 2017. Winnie explores Mandikizela-Mandela's contribution to the struggle against apartheid from the inside country. The work includes interviews with Madikizela-Mandela herself, those who were closest to her, and those who sought to extinguish her radical capacity to shake up the order of things. Lamche's account of the political life of Winnie includes fascinating archival footage, extensive interviews with her, her daughter Zindzi, and those who sought her downfall. Though firmly on the side of Winnie, this film, nonetheless, offers a unique perspective on recent South African history. In the process, it restores Madikizela-Mandela as a key figure in the liberation of South Africa. Source: Supplied
