The National Peace, Development and Democracy Conference which took place at Mekelle was fruitful in ensuring the need to forge public's active participation for a peaceful and developed country, Tigray Communications Affairs Bureau said. Bureau Public Relations Head Redaie Halefom told The Ethiopian Herald that the four-day conference deliberated on ensuring good governance with the active participation of the public and transformation agenda of the State. The Conference which was held following the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF) Evaluation Reform stressed the need to guarantee nations, nationalities and people's active participation in fighting corruption, maladministration and rent seeking tendencies that would cause harm in country's development journey, the Head added. Redaie said: "Conference of this kind gives ample opportunity to the public to exercise their role in the decision-making process thereby ensure country's peace and development and accelerate the execution of the planned goals." Stating the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has been encountered by some challenges, the Head noted that the Front is employing different mechanisms including fostering public participation in the view to overcome the problems. According to Redaie, the participants of the Conference expressed commitment to work in concert with the government to defend their country and to fight anti-peace elements.
