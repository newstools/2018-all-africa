Gaborone â€” China will continue to provide medical assistance to Botswana by sending medical teams to treat diseases, Chinese ambassador to Botswana Zhao Yanbo said Thursday. At a reception welcoming the 15th Chinese medical team to Botswana held at the Chinese Embassy, Zhao said medical teams in recent years have not only brought advanced medical technology and expertise, but also trained a large number of local medical staff through clinical teaching and academic lectures. The envoy said China's fruitful contribution to the country's medical services has helped Botswana to better achieve the goal of poverty eradication, as diseases contribute to poverty. He also said that Chinese medical teams have become a good example of the long-standing friendship and tangible cooperation between the two countries, adding that they currently work in 43 African countries. The 15th medical team consists of 46 members from top hospitals in east China's Fujian Province, 24 of whom are assigned to work in Princess Marina Hospital, while the other 22 will work in Nyangabwe Hospital in Francistown for two years. Chen Lieping, leader of the medical team, said the new arrivals are a highly skilled team specialized in the treatment of various diseases, and are expected to deliver the best medical care in the two major hospitals. Alfred Madigele, Botswana's minister of health and wellness, said that over the years, the number of medical teams has increased in line with the growing demand for health services and other specialized services.
