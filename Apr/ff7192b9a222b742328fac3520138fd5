Hitmaker Gazza was invited to perform at the main stage at the Young African Commonwealth event in Brisbane, Australia, tomorrow, 11 April, alongside artists such as Moonchild Sanelly, Spoek Mathamba, Mim Suleiman and Morena Leraba. This year, the Young African Commonwealth event, which is a part of the main Commonwealth Games, will be celebrating Nelson Mandela's 100th birthday with a mix of African music set to inspire, empower and, of course, entertain. Gazza, who will be sharing the stage with GMP's DJ Shoza and Max, follows in the footsteps of Papa Shikongeni, who performed at a show organised by the Commonwealth Games in Scotland in 2014. "It's going to be my first time on the continent and it's very special to me," Gazza said. "The mere fact that they recognised me is amazing." Determined to represent the country well, Gazza said he's looking forward to the performance. "It's going to open up new horizons for me. They trusted me and I'm going to show them what they chose me for." Speaking to The Namibian, Gazza's manager Desiree Klemp confirmed the performance. "I think it's an amazing opportunity for Gazza," she said.
