The Auditor-General of South Africa has announced the termination of contracts with auditing firms KPMG and Nkonki Inc. KPMG suffered a year of bad publicity due to allegations of misconduct over work done for Gupta-linked companies and a role in the controversial South African Revenue Service "rogue unit" report. Chief executive of Nkonki Inc. Mitesh Patel resigned from his post after investigative journalism unit amaBhungane exposed that his R107-million "management buyout" of the trailblazing black auditing firm was funded by Salim Essa, an associate of the Gupta family.
