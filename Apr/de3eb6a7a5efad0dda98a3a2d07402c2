In his lyrics, the priest urges youths to work hard. "Vijana come church, Yesu the Messiah tena ndiye sonko, miujiza amedo Bethania Galilea watu wengi amefeed kwa mkate na samaki," goes part of his lyrics. Congregants clap along to the beat as the priest raps on. The video that was shared by a user on Group Kenya has so far been shared by over 290 other users.
