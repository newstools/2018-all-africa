It is a hip-hop affair at Club 1+1 at Longecheng Plaza tonight when Tehn Diamond, Junior Brown and Take Fizzo whose combination is known as Few Kings meet for a performance. The musicians have done several projects together and tonight's show will solidify their music affair. The Few Kings host energetic songstress Tamy Moyo, who has been doing well on the local music scene. Most hip-hop followers believe Few Kings carry hopes for the genre and the trio will have to prove that they are up to the task. Individually, the members have lots of hits and even more as a group. The genre has a youthful following and has seen several talented musicians pursuing it with passion. Organisers of the show believe the venue will push hip-hop to commendable levels and they will continue hosting young artistes. "Hip-hop is a genre that we will keep pushing. We want the movement to keep its momentum. We have also hosted dancehall musicians because we believe the young singers will be tomorrow's superstars. " We are always ready to support young blood. "People should come and support Tamy as she works with Few Kings. It promises to be a good show," said one of the organisers. For Tamy, the stage is her second home having performed at the Madison Square Garden in New York City as a teenager. In her teens, she has also graced the HIFA and NAMA stages and recently she had a tour in Europe which further added to her experience catalogue. The show is costing $5 ordinary tickets and $10 for VIP. DJs from DTL Entertainment will be on rotation at the event.
