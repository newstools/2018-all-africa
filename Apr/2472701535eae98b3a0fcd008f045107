Hollywood actor, John Boyega has been addressing different issues since his arrival to Nigeria. At an interview in Cool FM, OAPs Kaylah Oniwoh and Daddy Freeze used the opportunity to bring up the rift that happened between Boyega's bodyguard and media personality Toke Makinwa at a restaurant in January this year. Full of surprise, he asked: "Who is that?" He also denied having a bodyguard during that period and will look into the matter at a later time.
