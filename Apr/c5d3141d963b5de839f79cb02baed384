Today therefore is a landmark in the journey we have been trekking," he said. "This is phase one. We look forward to continuous progress - a journey of a thousand miles begins today." The Uganda Hotel and Tourism Training Institute (UHTTI) started in mid of 1980's after a feasibility study under the project UNDP/ILO/UG/30.The institute was established at Fairway Hotel in Kampala in 1989 as a pilot school under the ILO/UNDP. When Fairway Hotel was repossessed by its original owners in 1991, ILO/UNDP pulled out of the project, leaving it entirely to the Government of Uganda. In her remarks, the Permanent Secretary in the Tourism Ministry Doreen Katusiime said that the skills to be gained from the revamped and better equipped UHTTI-Jinja will be of International standard and are expected to bridge the skills gap that had beleaguered our sector for long. "Today marks a new beginning as we usher into a place that produces highly qualified and competent Human Resource for the Hospitality Industry" ,Patricia Sempa, the Board chairperson said. ***** SOURCE JINJA CITY MEDIA
