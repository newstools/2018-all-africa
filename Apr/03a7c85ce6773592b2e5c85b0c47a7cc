//Karas regional health director Bartholomeus Muntenda yesterday confirmed that the 37 Keetmanshoop residents who had been in contact with a deceased Congo fever victim have been released from quarantine after being cleared of the disease. The 37-year-old Hendrik Hartebees died of Congo fever last week in the Windhoek Central Hospital, two weeks after being admitted to the Keetmanshoop State Hospital with the disease. Muntenda said the 37 people, including a medical doctor and two nurses, did not show any signs of infection during the quarantine period. The regional health directorate, in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, continues taking measures to prevent further infections of Congo fever. As part of the preventative measures, health officials have fumigated the Keetmanshoop State Hospital. Muntenda also confirmed that a tick was found in a hospital theatre during the fumigation. However, he could not say whether the tick could be linked to the Congo fever victim. "It is the season of ticks, and the one found in the hospital could have dropped from any other patient," he stated. He added that the theatre was closed for 72 hours for fumigation in order to return it to its "clean status", explaining that patients who had to undergo operations were referred to hospitals at Mariental and in Windhoek. Muntenda could also not say whether the tick found in the theatre was of the type that transmits Congo fever. "We did not investigate that; we just immediately burnt the tick as we were in panic," he said. "In future, if we find a tick in the hospital, we will conduct a thorough investigation on it," he added. "We have learnt a lesson, and would study it," he stressed.
