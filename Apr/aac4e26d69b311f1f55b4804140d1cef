Mombasa — Tanzanian artiste Alikiba on Thursday morning tied the knot in Mombasa at a colorful wedding that was attended by invited guests only. Ali Saleh Kiba and his brother Abdu Kiba arrived at Ummul Kulthum Mosque in the company of Kiba's close friend, Hassan Joho, who is also the Governor of Mombasa County. The musician was dressed in a black gown, a turban and a dagger - a custom for Swahili weddings. After citing a few Quran verses, Sheikh Mohammed Kagera, who presided over the ceremony, held Kiba's wrist in fulfilling his marriage to his fiancée, Ms Amina Khalef. Later on, Mr Kiba pronounced: "I, Ali Saleh, have agreed to marry Ms Amina Khalef for the dowry agreed between us and in case of divorce, let it be in good will." According to reliable sources close to both families, the wedding was conducted early in the morning to avoid "gate crashers". Alikiba then proceeded to the house of Governor Joho's brother, Abubakar Joho, in Kizingo for a meal after the wedding known as "kombe la bwana harusi". The reception was due to be held at Joho's mansion in Vipingo Ridge, Kilifi. The bride was later expected to "walk down the aisle" at Diamond Jubilee Hall in Kongowea in a women's-only event as per Swahili traditions. "Mr Joho is our family friend. I brought him up, and assisted him in his campaigns and that's how we grew closer. When my daughter told me about the man who had fallen in love with her, I enquired. When I knew Mr Joho was involved, I blessed the union," said the bride's mother, Ms Asma Said. Ms Said, a renowned campaigner in Kongowea, said she never expected her daughter to marry a foreigner or a celebrity. "But when I realised that it was God-ordained, I blessed the two. Alikiba is a good, responsible and disciplined man. I wish them the best. My daughter is happy and in love," she added.
