London Marathon champion Vivian Cheruiyot has admitted she didn't expect to emerge victorious on Sunday as the favourites, Mary Keitany and Tirunesh Dibaba, were on a mission to break the world record. Pre-race favourite Keitany had made her intentions public of lowering the World Record of 2:15.25 currently held by Briton Paula Radcliffe, but the weather conditions proved too harsh forcing Dibaba to drop out while the Kenyan came in fifth place. "I knew there was a plan to go for the record that day and the pace was very fast. That is why I planned to be third behind Mary (Keitany) and Tirunesh (Dibaba)," Cheruiyot told Nation Sport yesterday, moments after returning from London. Cheruiyot took advantage of Dibaba and Keitany's epic collapse in the latter stages of the race to win her second career marathon. "I was targeting to run under 2:20 but clocking 2:18:31 came as a surprise to me. I was very happy because this was my first victory in a major marathon and I had improved my personal best time," said the athlete, fondly known as "Pocket Rocket." "Last year, I was in fourth in London in my first marathon. I didn't have the experience then but now I know what to do during races." Cheruiyot, the Rio Olympics 5,000m gold medallist, said she will now take a break before resuming training as she eyes one more race this year. "My husband (Moses Kurui) has really helped me in terms of training and that is why I have been doing well. I'm very happy. I know I still have a long journey ahead." Brigid Kosgei finished second after clocking 2:20:13 while Ethiopia's Tadelech Bekele was third.
