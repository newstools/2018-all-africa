The directorate of education in the Zambezi region has relocated 50 Grade 9 and 10 pupils from Muzii Combined School in the Kabbe North constituency due to the fast rising floods. The acting Zambezi regional eduction director, Jooste Kawana, on Wednesday told The Namibian that although the floods have not been declared a disaster, they had decided to relocate the pupils because Muzii Combined School was greatly affected by floods. "We saw a great need to relocate these pupils urgently, although we still have to get permission from our head office. Nonetheless, the relocation of pupils and teachers which started yesterday, is going smoothly and they will be accommodated at Lusese Combined School. We expect teaching and learning to proceed as normal by Monday after they have settled in," he said. Kawana further said two schools also affected by the floods such as Mpukano primary and Namiyundu Combined schools were instructed to finish their assessment by Friday so that they could close for the term. "If they do not finish all the work now, they will compensate for the loss when the school re-opens for the second term by ensuring that they teach in the mornings and during weekends," he said. Efforts to get a comment from the ministry of education's head office were unsuccessful as questions sent to the spokesperson, Absalom Absalom, went unanswered. Education permanent secretary Sanet Steenkamp yesterday said she cannot comment as she was still to be briefed by the regional director on the matter.
