Liverpool forward Mohamed 'Mo' Salah is increasingly earning plaudits from footballer fans, with some suggesting the Egyptian should be awarded with the world's best player award. Days after winning the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Player of the Year gong for the 2017-2018 season after a stellar first season at Liverpool, the 25-year-old was at his element again on Tuesday night, scoring twice - his 42nd and 43rd goals of the season - to lead Liverpool to a 5-2 victory over AS Roma in the first leg of the Uefa Champions League semi-final. These performances have not only led the African striker being compared with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, but have also invited suggestions that he should be awarded the Ballon d'Or this season. "You've got to give him the Ballon d'Or." Is Mo Salah going to end the Ronaldo/Messi dominance? https://t.co/lzIburIuRe pic.twitter.com/fige70MD6u -- BBC Sport (@BBCSport) April 25, 2018 Congrats to @22mosalah , unbelievable achievement .. #theegyptianking -- Robbie Fowler (@Robbie9Fowler) April 23, 2018 ðŸŽ¶ Mo Salah, Mo Salah, running down the wing ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¬ðŸ‘‘#UCL @mosalah pic.twitter.com/wxyveDQC67 -- UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) April 24, 2018 Do you think Mo Salah deserves to be the next Ballon D'or winner?ðŸ¤” #KOEngage pic.twitter.com/Zg4UBZHcQB -- Kick Off (@KickOffMagazine) April 25, 2018 I ain't a mo salah fan but am dying ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/TiR5GFlyb0 -- +256 (@ditox_bling) April 25, 2018 Of immediate importance though to the Ballon d'Or hopeful, would be if Mo Salah can both help Liverpool win the Uefa Champions League and spearhead a successful Egyptian campaign at the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia. Liberia President George Weah is the only African footballer to have won the Ballon d'Or, and that was back in 1995.
