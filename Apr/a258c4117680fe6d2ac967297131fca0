Nairobi â€” Eliud Kipchoge produced a mastered, tactful race to clinch his third London marathon crown, shaking off Ethiopia's Shola Tura to cut the tape in a time of 2:04:16. Shura stuck on Kipchoge's shoulder like a tick for almost 10km when the Kenyan road running kingpin decided to shake himself away from the pack, but Kipchoge changed gears in the final 2km leaving the Ethiopian gasping for breath. The Ethiopian managed to hold on for second spot in a time of 2:05:00 while home boy Mo Farah finished third in a time of 2:06:32. Abel Kirui and Bedan Karoki finished fourth and fifth respectively.
