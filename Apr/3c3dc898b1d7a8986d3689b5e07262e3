President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday got a rude welcome in London after a section of Kenyans held a demonstration and heckled him outside Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House). The president had just delivered his speech at the institute on areas of modern partnerships between developing countries and those of the developed world. He also outlined his plan for Kenya in his final term and explained last month's handshake with opposition leader Raila Odinga. Mr Kenyatta assured Kenyans abroad that they will vote in the 2022 general elections. "By 2022, all mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that the entire diaspora (population) will be able to participate in the general election," said President Kenyatta, who was responding to a question by an accountant living in the United Kingdom. WHISKED AWAY At the end of his speech, his security detail was forced to whisk him away as the heckling crowd called on him to respect the rule of law. President Kenyatta is on a five day state visit to the United Kingdom. The demonstrators waved placards written "respect human rights" and "respect rule of law". They accused president Kenyatta of abusing human rights, ignoring rule of law and mismanaging the economy. Also present was a crowd of Mr Kenyatta's supporters chanted "Uhuru is justice". They carried placards with messages expressing support for Mr Kenyatta's Big Four Agenda in his second term. Videos circulated on social media showing the protesters also demanding justice for fiery lawyer Miguna Miguna, who was deported under controversial circumstances. This is not the first Kenyan leaders have received a cold reception in London. Last year, pro-Jubilee supporters held a similar protest when Nasa leader Raila Odinga gave a lecture at the same venue.
