President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday rang the bell to mark the beginning of trading at the London Stock Exchange as his five-day official tour of the United Kingdom commenced in earnest. He was accompanied to the event seeking to promote Kenya as the preferred investment destination among global investors by Adan Mohamed, Cabinet Secretary for Industry, Trade and Cooperatives. Speaking after ringing the bell to commence trading at the London Stock Exchange, the president confirmed that National Oil Corporation would dual list on both Nairobi and London Stock Exchanges. The president will then meet investors to discuss investment opportunities in Kenya for his Big Four agenda and job creation and the Blue Economy global conference, which Kenya will host later in the year. Mr Kenyatta will on Tuesday deliver a lecture at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, commonly known as Chatham House to outline his development plans for his final term as well as regional peace. The president is also in the UK to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and is also scheduled to meet and hold talks with Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Theresa May. The president was received by Jeremy Fern, representative of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II when he landed at Royal Air Force Northolt airport in London.
