The South African Music Awards (Samas) have released a full list of the this year's entrants, showing an impressive increase from years before. According to a statement released by HM Entertainment, this year the Samas office received 778 eligible entries - up from last year's 740 and 470 in 2016. For the second year in a row, the Samas office makes public the complete list of entries. RiSA CEO Nhlanhla Sibisi says this bodes well for the Samas: "We are still committed to the practice of openness and transparency and a fair selection process. We release these entries for the industry and music supporters to be kept abreast of the developments as we progress through the stages of the Sama. We also do so to avoid any surprises when we announce the final nomination list in the next few weeks." The most popular category Best Music Video of the Year received 127 entries, followed by Best Collaboration which attracted some 100 submissions. Best Produced Album stands at 86 while Best Dance Album boasts 53. Recording companies and interested parties were invited to submit entries over a period of three months starting in November 2017 until February 2018. A stringent vetting process presided over by RiSA officials and record company representatives ensured that the entries met all the eligibility requirements. Those who ticked all the boxes have been handed over to panels of independent judges drawn from radio, television, newspapers, blogs and the recording industry for judging. The Sama office will release only five nominees in each category as voted for by the panels and verified by an independent audit firm. Source: Supplied
