At least three civilians, including a woman, were reported to have been killed a suspected US drone strike in central Somalia on Monday. The airstrike was carried out at Da'ar, an Al-Shabaab-controlled area located about 20 Kilometers west of Elbur district in Galgadud region of central Somalia. Two prominent local elders identified as Ali Hared and Yusuf Dhegay were among those killed in the drone attack, according to a statement released by Al Shabaab. Sources in the area said the drone has fired a missile targeting a convoy carrying civilians on the outskirts of Elbur. Al Shabaab had denied claims that 10 militants killed in the raid. US military has intensified the airstrikes against the Al Shabab following October 14 deadly truck bombing that killed more than 512 people in Mogadishu's Zoobe junction.
