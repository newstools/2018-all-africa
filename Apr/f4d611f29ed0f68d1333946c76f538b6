Following the announcement marking the closure of the EU Climate Change Grant to the Nyae Nyae Development Foundation of Namibia, the EU ambassador to Namibia, Jana Hybaskova, visited several project sites in the Nyae Nyae Conservancy area. This was an opportunity to see what had effectively been achieved on the ground during the project's duration. The ambassador revisited two villages that were visited twice before, when the project was in its early days. The progress that had been made and the changes were clearly visible and the people of the conservancies were rightly proud of their achievements. Gardens were cultivated, food was diversified, trees produced fruit, cattle was well herded and water availability had been secured. A real tangible and dramatic improvement for the conservancy residents and one that has truly empowered them and make them feel more secure and confident about their futures was achieved. The ambassador also met with chief Tsamkao, of the Ju/'hoansi Traditional Authority where the chief and conservancy thanked the EU for their interest, engagement and investment in the area. The project has focused on diversifying livelihoods of the local San community through agriculture, livestock management, devils claw harvesting and rangeland management in order to improve food security and resilience to climate change shocks. The project has also supported the expansion of water infrastructure and storage to support the increased agricultural activities and herds.
