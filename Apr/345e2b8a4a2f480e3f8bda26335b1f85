Media statement on the Cape Town Refugee Reception Centre Good afternoon, we have called this media briefing to provide an update on the Cape Town Refugee Reception Office. As you may know, the Western Cape High Court favoured the Department Home Affairs to close the refugee office in Cape Town. Then after, the Scaralbini centre appealed the matter to Supreme Court of Appeals which ruled in their favour. Then the department appealed the matter to the Constitutional Court which dismissed and directed the department to comply with the 2017 Supreme Court order on 6th of December 2017. We have thus begun to comply with the court order. Let me put it on record that the Department of Home Affairs has no intention to disregard the judicial directive and we will duly respect the judgement. In this regard, we have commenced with plans to comply with the order. We have allocated a budget within the ambits of the current base line. We have prioritised the funding and filing of key posts to get the centre operational. However the department is dependent on Public Works to provide suitable office accommodation. To this end, we have engaged the Department of Public Works who, in turn, have issued a procurement instruction to their regional office in Cape Town. Public Works have provided a project execution plan on 06 April 2018. It is also important for me to add that the Department continues to provide existing clients with the services at the current office accommodation, as the South African government is a signatory to various U.N Conventions and we have committed ourselves to assisting those who have come to our country for assistance. The department will continue uphold its constitutional obligation to those in need of protection from any form of persecution. I thank you. Issued by: Department of Home Affairs
