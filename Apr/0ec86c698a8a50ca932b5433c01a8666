The Chief of Army Staff, Lt.General Tukur Buratai, who inaugurated the committee in Abuja, Monday morning , at the Nigerian ArmyHeadquarters, said the Army under him was visibly disturbed at the allegations, especially coming from respected senior citizens of the country. Buratai charged the committee, headed by Major General John Nimyel, rtd, to go all out to unravel all circumstances leading to the allegations, vowing that personnel of the service found to have compromised in their services to the country would not be spared.
