Chinese President Xi Jinping has told President Emmerson Mnangagwa that they should work towards a new chapter in ties, during the Zimbabwe leader's first state visit to China since he seized power in 2017. Mnangagwa, who was sworn in as president in November after a military takeover that ended Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule, is under pressure to bring back foreign investors and resolve a severe cash crisis, mass unemployment and dramatic price increases.
