Nairobi â€” Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi is on Tuesday scheduled to face the parliamentary committee on National Security and Administration to give a report on the circumstances surrounding controversial lawyer Miguna Miguna's deportation. Matiangi will face the committee together with the Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho and Immigration, Registration and Border Control PS Gordon Kihalangwa. They are expected to explain why they defied court orders not to deport Miguna, leading to their conviction and fining of Sh200,000 for contempt of court. Miguna arrived in Toronto on Sunday after more than a week of drama at the Jomo Kenyatta International and Dubai airport and has vowed to return to Kenya as soon as he is done with medical tests. One of his lawyers, Nelson Havi, said Miguna left Dubai on his own volition and with the assistance of the Canadian Consulate in United Arab Emirates. Through his twitter account, Havi said that he will undergo toxicology tests and treatment for the chemicals used to sedate him and thereafter return. Miguna was deported to Dubai after he declined to produce his Canadian passport and sign documents that would allow him entry into Kenya. The plane carrying the self-proclaimed General of National Revolutionary Movement departed Dubai at 12.50am for Canada.
