Liquid Telecom, a regional data, voice and IP service provider, has set a target of making sure at least 20,000 households get access to broadband internet and, so far, more than half have access right outside their doorsteps. The company's Chief Technical Officer says that before the end of the next financial year, the roll-out of broadband network will have been completed.
