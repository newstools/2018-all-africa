Nairobi â€” RECURRING floods ravaging Kenya have left at least eight people dead and three others missing. The deaths have been confirmed in Kinangop in the central Nyandarua County while missing persons have been reported in Nyatike in the southwestern Migori County. More than 700 families have been displaced due to the floods in the two areas. Humanitarian agencies forecast the heavy rains to continue affecting several areas of the East African country resulting in further casualties and damages. "Over the next 24 hours, more rainfall is expected to continue over the central and southern parts of the country, including the already affected areas," the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, stated on Tuesday. Flooding has afflicted Kenya since March when 15 people died. Authorities estimate flooding has killed more than 20 people and displaced over 33 000 since then. Flooding comes after successive seasons of drought.
