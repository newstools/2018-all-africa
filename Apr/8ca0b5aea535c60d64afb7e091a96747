Twitter users have taken to the social media website with the hashtag #RIPOdwa to honour Odwa Shweni, the actor who died while filming a fight scene at the Sterkspruit waterfall in the Drakensberg. The 39-year-old from Centurion in Johannesburg is believed to have lost his footing and fell 40m off a cliff before his body was later recovered.
