Team Dimension Data's Bernhard Eisel has undergone successful surgical decompression of a chronic subdural haematoma on the brain. The lesion was a late complication of his crash on Stage 5 of the Tirreno-Adriatico earlier this year. A chronic subdural haematoma is an accumulation of blood beneath the protective layer around the brain, the dura mater. The bleeding occurs slowly over a number of weeks and eventually the collection of clotted blood puts pressure on the brain, thereby causing symptoms. Eisel had a CAT scan of the brain immediately after his crash but no intracranial bleed was present at that time. Eisel thought he was suffering from severe allergies late last week and was struggling to train. Upon a follow-up consult by the medical team, he revealed that his symptoms included a severe headache. An urgent MRI scan of the brain was ordered in light of his recent trauma, revealing the haematoma. Surgery was required to evacuate the collection, releasing the pressure. The team confirmed that the surgery was successfully carried out on Monday at the Maria Hilf Private Clinic in Klagenfurt, Austria, with no complications. Eisel will be able to begin with light training on the turbo trainer in two weeks and hopefully a return to full outdoor training in four weeks after a follow-up MRI. "Firstly, I want to get healthy, take my time and if the doctors give me the go-ahead I will consider when is best to return on my bike," said Eisel. " "I still enjoy riding my bike but this was a massive thing that happened to my body. If you have an operation on your brain it certainly makes you think twice about things but at the moment I will just follow the recommendations of our team doctors. "At the moment I am feeling good and looking forward to leaving the hospital and spending some time with family." Source: Sport24
