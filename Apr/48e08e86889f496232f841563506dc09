Rayon Sports has become the first Rwandan club to reach the mini-league stage of a major continental club championship. The Kigali giants lost 2-0 in Maputo to Mozambican side, Costa do Sol, but progressed 3-2 on aggregate to achieve the historic feat. The Mozambicans scored two first half goals courtesy of a brace from Isaac de Carvalho in the 30th and 45th minutes, besides missing a penalty. Rayon held on backed by spirited defending in the second half whilst goalkeeper Eric Ndayishimiye pulled two great saves to deny Lawrence Tisdell and Carvalho. "This is a sweet victory because we have qualified for the group stage. This year we made it to the group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup. This is football and sometimes you fail to win but reach your target. "I am happy for the reaction in second half after failing to impress in first half," Rayon coach Ivan Minneart said after the game.
