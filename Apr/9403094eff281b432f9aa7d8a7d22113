Kenya Film Classification Board boss Ezekiel Mutua became the butt of hilarious jokes after he compared himself to American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Junior. In a tweet on Wednesday, Mr Mutua outlines characteristics he claimed to share with Dr King. He also claimed to have a striking physical resemblance to Dr King. "They called him the moral champion of the black revolution in the United States. They call me the moral police of Kenya. The resemblance is striking. The inspiration unmistakable. . . . And like him, I HAVE A DREAM. . . Long live the memory of Dr. Luther King!" They called him the moral champion of the black revolution in the United States. They call me the moral police of Kenya.

"I have a dream that when this new story about Kenya is written I will have played a role in it. So help me God," wrote Mr Mutua on Facebook. Kenyans on Twitter were not impressed with the comparison. pic.twitter.com/cRXyRKk0gk -- Ciru Muriuki ツ (@CiruMuriuki) April 5, 2018 Ha ha really ciru? pic.twitter.com/WanHYVxNh4 -- cleophas muthama (@CleophasMuthama) April 5, 2018 pic.twitter.com/o2wU8zJjyd -- Me.
