Indian president Ram Nath Kovind has described Zambia's late presidents Levy Mwanawasa, Fredrick Chiluba and Michael Sata as inspirational leaders in driving the country's development agenda forward. Mr Kovind said each of the fallen presidents pioneered nation building, with Mr Chiluba leaving an indelible mark on economic transformation. He said Mr Mwanawasa significantly contributed to institutionalising good governance. Mr Kovind said he admired Mr Sata's focus on promoting the robust implementation of infrastructure and social service projects. He said the late presidents tireless service and sacrifice would be remembered for a long time. "On behalf of the people and the Government of India, I pay my respectful homage to the late Zambian presidents," Mr Kovind said. He said this in a written message, in the presidents' visitors' book at the Embassy Park presidential burial site which he visited and laid wreaths, in Lusaka yesterday. He was taken on a tour of the trio's individual mausoleums by the National Heritage Conservation Commission, East and Central region director Kagosi Mwamulowe. Mr Kovind urged the country's future generations to take pride in the achievements of the trio in fostering development. And the Indian president has said that Zambia's peace within and with its neighbours has made it a role model in the strife-ridden world. Mr Kovind said in a message he wrote in the State House visitors' book that Zambia's selfless support of many Southern African countries in their struggle for freedom was an everlasting inspiration for people across the world. He said the people of India had great admiration for the history and culture of Zambia. "Zambia's non-violent and peaceful movement for independence has been a guiding light for its external relations, in particular relations with its neighbours, which makes Zambia an exemplary role model in a strife ridden world today," Mr Kovind said.
