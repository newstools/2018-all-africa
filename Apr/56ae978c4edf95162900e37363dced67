Kibabii Teachers College again proved their mettle among their peers when they emerged winners in the teacher training colleges' segment at the Kenya National Drama and Film Festival. Kibabii, last year's winners in the play, modern dance and choral verse categories successfully defended all their titles to the frustration of other colleges that had hoped to upset the apple cart. Their winning play, The Pendulum 2, was simply a cut above the rest in the otherwise highly competitive festival. It was scripted by Masinde Muliro University lecturer, Dr Ralph Wangatiah, and produced by the college principal, Mr Saul Barasa. WINNING PLAY Pendulum 2 is a continuation of last year's winning play Pendulum 1, based on a real life story of a family torn apart by deep rivalry between two brothers. The college staged the play at the gala event held at Lenana School yesterday. The gala presentations continue today with the Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed being the chief guest. Unity theme brings curtains down on fete Mr Barasa attributed the college's success to dedication by the students and their trainers. The event, now in its 59th edition, was held in Nairobi, with the hosts being Lenana School, State House Girls and Moi Girls.
