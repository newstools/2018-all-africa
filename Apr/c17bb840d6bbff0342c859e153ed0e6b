Kampala â€” The second batch of team Uganda has left the country for Gold coast, Australia for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. A team of 13 runners, a javelin thrower and coach Nalis Bigingo have been flagged off this afternoon at the National Sports Complex at Lugogo by AIGP Andrew Sorowen. The Games opening ceremony is tomorrow and action begins Thursday. Mr Sorowen urged the team to have discipline and a spirit of ambassadorship. "Be disciplined, don't shame us; listen to your coaches always," Sorowen said. "When he tells you to slow down at some stage, do so because he knows why he's telling you to do so." "And run for the good of your country. Be good ambassadors," he added. Marathon runners Solomon Mutai, Robert Chemonges, Jacob Kiplimo and Alex Chesakit will join them on Saturday.
