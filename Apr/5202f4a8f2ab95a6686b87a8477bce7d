Words have proven once more that they were real as Anto, Lolu and Khloe had foretold their own Eviction. Anto and Khloe who had been voted back into the House to great acclaim by the #BBBringBack campaign have come to the end of their Double Wahala dream. Just a few days ago, the two had been speculating about the possibility of not making it to the Finale. For Khloe, tonight marked her first Eviction. Khloe one of the two Housemates to have been Disqualified earlier in the season and Anto had returned into the House determined to give the best of themselves. While Khloe’s sensible and caring side came out more, Anto’s leadership and vulnerability will remain in the BBNaija chronicles. For some reason, Lolu had also anticipated his own Eviction having confessed an unusual nervousness. The self-effaced geeky Housemate had entered the House with his simple and unpretentious manners that could nonetheless not be discarded by any of the other more flamboyant characters. If anything, thanks to his irresistible brains, Lolu has offered a sweet revenge to all those whose need for love has gone unfulfilled by winning the minds and hearts of his peers. Big Brother applauds these remarkable Housemates and wishes them the happiest and brightest of futures.
