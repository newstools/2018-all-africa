Premier Supra Mahumapelo has welcomed the decisive Cabinet decision to invoke Section 100(1)(b) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 to address the apparent crisis, particularly in the health sector. "We welcome this intervention and will give it our full cooperation to ensure that the health services of our province are normalised." Mahumapelo appointed a team of 3 MECs to intervene in the Department of Health and says the team has made strides in their engagement with NEHAWU which will be shared with the national team. Mahumapelo has further emphasised that the province will cooperate with the Inter-Ministerial Task Team which is appointed to deal with critical issues in the province. The province witnessed the eruption of violent protests last week which resulted in the destruction of property. Issued by: North West Office of the Premier
