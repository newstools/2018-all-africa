Rafiki follows the aspirations of two young women, Kena and Ziki, whose families happen to be on opposing sides of the political divide - and their story of friendship, love, loyalty. This disparity is the basis for the struggles they must endure as they attempt to support each other in the pursuit of their dreams. They face immense pressures and ultimately have to make a tough choice: happiness or safety? The Cannes Film Festival is set to run from May 8 to May 17, and we're super excited to see what critics think about Rafiki!
