In a move which infringes the consistent pronouncements by President Emmerson Mnangagwa that his administration would break with the past and uphold the rule of law and property rights, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga's wife, Mary Chiwenga, has reportedly taken possession of a farm belonging to the Agriculture Rural Development Authority, a farming parastatal. The alleged farm takeover has led to Zimbabweans speculating on whether barely 5 months after Robert Mugabe's fall, they may have a new Grace Mugabe.
