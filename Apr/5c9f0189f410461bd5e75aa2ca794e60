Egypt's Mohamed Salah scored two goals and the same number of assists as Liverpool secured a 5-2 victory over Roma in the first leg of their semi-final Champions League clash on Tuesday night at Anfield. FIFA tweeted that the two goals make Salah the first African player to score 10 goals in a single Champions League campaign.
