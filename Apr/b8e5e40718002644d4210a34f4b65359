Exceptionally heavy rains have forced the postponement of the second leg of the Kenya National Rally Championship from May 6 to 13. Wet, but not impassable roads are still anticipated in this Kenya Motor Sports Club event. As both the driver and navigator championships are close, the rally will be hotly contested. Kabras Sugar-sponsored Baldev Chager heads the driver standings with 53 points in his Mitsubishi Evolution X. He is closely followed by Carl "Flash" Tundo with 50 points earned in his Top Fry Mitsubishi Evolution X sponsored by Menengai Oil Refineries. There is a tie in the navigator championships leadership with both Ravi Soni and Tim Jessop on 53 points. Tuta Mionki is in third place in a Menengai Cream-sponsored Subaru Impreza N12 with a score of 30 points. Clerk of the Course Jim Kahumbura said the rally will start from the KCB branch in Kitengela and head to Isinya, Konza through the Kapita plains. where there will be two stages.
