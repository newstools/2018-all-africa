Tunisia Sunday conceded defeat to Estonia 2-3 following Davis Cup (Euro-Africa Zone) Group II day-2 qualifiers in the Estonian capital Tallinn. Tunisia's Malek Jaziri lost to JÃ¼rgen Zopp 0-2 (1-6, 4-6), while Aziz Ouakaa snatched a win as he faced Kristjan Tamm 2-1 (6-4, 5-7, 10-7). But, this was insufficient considering Saturday's 1-2 defeat.
