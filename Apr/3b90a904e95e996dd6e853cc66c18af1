The African Development Bank is set to back coal-fired projects in Nigeria, Kenya and Senegal in a departure from the International Monetary Fund, which has a ban on fossil fuels. The bank's president, Akinwumi Adesina - who served previously as Nigeria's agriculture minister - has defended the move, saying that "Africa must develop its energy sector with what it has."
