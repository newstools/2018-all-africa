The suspension comes barely a week after Kenya Airports Authority announced increased parking fees at the airport's drop-off and pick-up parking zones. Parking would have cost U.S.$1 for under 20 minutes, U.S.$2,50 for 20 minutes and 40 minutes, U.S.$3,50 for 40 minutes and an hour and U.S.$5 for those staying for up to two hours.
