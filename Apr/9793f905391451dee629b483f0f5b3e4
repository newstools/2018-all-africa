The South African Democratic Teachers' Union in Free State has waged a strong fight against the Treasury and the Education Department for not paying temporary teachers their January - March salaries and schools' allocations for the 4th and 1st Terms. The Department of Education's failure to pay the temporary teachers constituted unfair labour practice in terms of Labour Relations Act. The Union then tabled the matter for resolution in the PELRC where a decision to seek a meeting with the senior officials of the two departments was taken. During the meeting with the two departments represented by the HOD (Education) and Treasury by the CEO (Treasury), the entire Provincial Executive Committee made up of 20 members represented SADTU. SADTU ensured that the meeting resolved on clear timeframes for the payment of temporary teachers and schools' allocations as follows: Payment of salaries of Temporary Teachers: 12 April 2018 Transfer of schools' allocations: 30 April 2018 It was further agreed that there should be an urgent meeting to take discussions forward so as to avoid the repeat of the situation. On 12 April 2018, temporary teachers were paid and the Union applauds the Departments for honouring their commitment to pay teachers at the end of every month. We are looking forward to the outstanding commitment of ensuring that allocations to schools are deposited into their accounts on the 30th of April 2018.
