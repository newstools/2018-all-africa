Old Mutual Zimbabwe chief executive officer, Jonas Mushosho, says the effects of Zimbabwe's hyperinflation, which ruined the economy and destroyed the domestic currency, will linger on for a long time. Mushosho, who is also Old Mutual Rest of Africa chief executive officer, said the devastation caused by the hyperinflationary crisis, which ended with dollarisation in 2009, is likely to affect Zimbabwe's economy for a long time.
