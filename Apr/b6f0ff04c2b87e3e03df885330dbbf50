Three new attacks, allegedly by Al-Shabaab, a militant youth group in northern Mozambique, have left an unconfirmed number of deaths in recent days. A spate of violence has erupted in the region since last year's string of attacks on police stations that left two officers and 14 attackers dead. Known locally as "Al-Shabaab", the group hasn't confirmed any link to the East Africa terrorist group of the same name.
