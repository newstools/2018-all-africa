"We must not allow this barbaric act to continue to prevail on our people. This is not right."Abomtse went on: "People are being killed and even security men sent here to maintain law are not spared. Since this attacks began January this year, 11 policemen, three civil defence and just yesterday (Monday) a soldier was killed in Guma, my local government area. "This is not right. We must respect rule of law. When people violate the law and there is no sanction, it results to impunity and we cannot allow impunity to continue in this state. "These attacks are gradually descending to impunity and if we allow impunity, it will deteriorate to anarchy. But we cannot continue to run from these people. We must protect our land even if it means using stones."He listed the areas attacked to include Mbapa, Mbapupuu, Mbachohon, Enger, among others all in Agagbe District of Gwer-West Local Council.
