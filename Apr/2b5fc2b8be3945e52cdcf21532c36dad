Celebrated Nigerian author Chimamanda Adichie has been named the winner of the 'Best in Literature' category at the 10th edition of the Shorty Awards held in New York. The Shorty Awards celebrate the best content creators and producers and brands that have the best presence on social media and the digital world. Those nominated alongside Adichie were Cleo Wade, Jon Ronson, Jonny Sun, Kevin Kwan and Rebecca Traister. Placing an emphasis on her recognition and promotion of 'Wear Nigerian' campaign, they state on their page, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has been one of the most internationally-acclaimed authors over the past 10 years. In addition to her novels, TED Talks, essays, and a speech sampled in a Beyonce's "Flawless," Chimamanda is responsible for drawing a new generation of readers to African literature. She uses her prominence to promote the beauty of her African heritage, and this year created an Instagram account for her "Wear Nigerian" campaign--a response to terrible economic policies that have hurt artisans in her home country. Her 100K+ Instagram followers and nearly 900K Facebook fans see all the amazing looks those designers create, while keeping up with the author's global travels promoting her work and giving lectures.
