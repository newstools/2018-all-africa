Zanzibar â€” The Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar yesterday launched a programme that will see all families in the isles receiving long lasting insecticide treated nets. The Zanzibar Minister for Health, Mr Rashid Hamad, launched the long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) continuous distribution programme yesterday, saying the nets will be issued directly to pregnant women while other community members will also get them by simply making their coupons available to the issuing authorities. Figures quoted by Mr Hamad noted that the Isles reported only 1,436 malaria cases for the whole of last year out of which only five people died. "Today, we are honoured to launch the LLINs continuous distribution programme whereby pregnant women, attending their first antenatal care and children receiving the first measles vaccination will receive LLINs free-of-charge. Members of community will receive LLINs at the health facilities using a coupon they receive from Shehas (community leaders)," he said. LLINs continuous distribution programme is jointly implemented by the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Program's VectorWorks Project funded by USAID through the US President's Malaria Initiative (PMI).
