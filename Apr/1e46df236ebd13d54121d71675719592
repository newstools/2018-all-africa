Nairobi residents woke up to heavy traffic jams and flooded roads as rains pounded the capital on Tuesday morning. The rains that started at dawn left flood-prone areas submerged, with emergency services concerned on the fate of people living near river banks and riparian areas. CRASHES A truck that rolled over early morning on Mombasa Road near the airport turnoff caused a traffic tailback all the way to Mlolongo. On the Eastern Bypass, a lorry rolled over on an underpass after hitting a ditch. Floodwaters filled major streets and avenues in the city, with some commuters wading through it as they alighted from matatus. The hop, skip and jump tactic worked for some but others were not as lucky as mud and slippery tarmac rendered their survival plan useless. Some were captured on mobile cameras going through the paces of 'hop, jump and slip'. The floods, once again, cast a spotlight on the sorry state of drainage in Nairobi, a perennial problem that both national and county governments have failed to fix for decades. DRAINAGE Some parts of the biggest commercial hub in East and Central Africa still use drainage and sewer lines that were constructed during the British colonial rule in 1950s and early 1960s. This is despite the capital's population expanding more than six times over the last six decades. Nairobi, with a population of more than 4 million, is both the seat of government of Kenya and the city county headquarters. The Kenya Meteorological Services had over the weekend warned of heavy downpour in the city that will continue throughout week.
