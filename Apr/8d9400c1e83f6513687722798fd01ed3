The South African Federation of Trade Unions and the National Union of Mineworkers have embarked on a national strikeÂ  against the Minimum Wage Bill which they say is too little for their members to enjoy a living wage. The protests are also for infrastructure challenges that include the building of proper roads. The situation in the Western Cape in particular has been made worse by the continuing bus strike, where transport workers are demanding a 12% increase and the unreliable, sporadic train service in the province.
