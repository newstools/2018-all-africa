Fresh from a romantic honeymoon with her hubby in tropical Mauritius, Gina Jeanz is heading straight back to work with a gig at the 2018 Red Bull Music Festival in Johannesburg this Saturday. The talented music producer, model and graphic designer is going to play at the festival which has a stellar line-up of acts including Shekhinah, AKA, Distruction Boyz and Trompies. Billed to attract 80 artists over the course of six days, the Red Bull Music Festival is described as a celebration of the artists at the forefront of the evolution of South African music over the last 20 years. The festival also features the first South African performance from UK grime superstar Skepta. Festival goers can expect a selection of kwaito, gqom, deep house, hip-hop, future beats, alternative pop and jazz at an event that promises to showcase some of South Africa's finest talent. This is not the first time that Gina Jeanz has booked a gig at a major South African musical platform, having played at Rocking The Daisies Music and Lifestyle Festival in October 2017. She then shared the platform with big musical acts such as Black Coffee, Cassper Nyovest and Ray Phiri. Neither is this the first time the multi-talented creative will be working with the Red Bull brand. Last year, she worked on the Red Bull Studio EP collaboration. The collab was met with rave reviews and in an earlier interview, she described working on the EP as a "magical experience".
