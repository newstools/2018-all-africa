A witness says troops belonging to Somali military have engaged a heavy gunfight in General Gordon training base in Mogadishu on Monday. The clash erupted after soldiers tried to storm the camp located near Benadir junction and loot the military equipment left by the UAE trainer last week. Reports from the scene indicate a heavy exchange of gunfire as UAE trained soldiers try to prevent the other troops from looting the base. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The base was taken over by Somali army command after the UAE military trained deserted it due to the soaring diplomat spat between Mogadishu and Abu Dhabi.
