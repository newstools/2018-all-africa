Peter Nielsen, the alleged killer of singer Zainab Nielsen - better known as Alizee - and her daughter, has pleaded not guilty to murder in a Lagos court. Nielsen is alleged to have killed the victims in the bedroom at their Banana Island residence and dragged their bodies to the kitchen to make it look like it was an accident.
