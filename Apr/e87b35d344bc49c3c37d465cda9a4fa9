NAMWATER has announced water rationing measures which will affect towns and villages in the three northern regions of Oshana, Ohangwena and Oshikoto. In a notice to the regional and local authorities, NamWater's chief of business unit north water supply, Kambanda Kaliki said the water rationing measures became necessary after water supply from Calueque in southern Angola was cut off a few weeks ago because water from the floodplains flowed into the canal, drastically increasing the amount of purification chemicals needed at the Oshakati water treatment plant. "The use of chemicals has been in excess of 500% of the normal rate, while balancing the rate of use against the stock from the suppliers has been a struggle, given the fact that the chemical supplies are from South Africa," he said. He said the objective of the interruption at night is to build up reserve for daytime use and to also sustain the limited available treated water. The ration started on Tuesday this week with no water supplies from 22h00 and 05h00 every night and it will end on 8 May, he said. Affected areas include towns and a number of rural villages in the three regions. Kaliki further said that any emergency need arising at essential services centres such as hospitals, clinics and school dormitories will be dealt with through delivery by water tankers.
