Jilted Tanzanian singer Diamond Platnumz has resorted to a cheesy way to hit back at his baby mama Zari Hassan. The musician released a series of steamy videos on Monday of himself in a room with a light-skinned woman engaging in different intimate scenes. Diamond is captured sleeping bare-chested on a bed while kissing the woman. His Wasafi Records artiste Harmonize is also in the room, seemingly enjoying the scene. The videos were captioned with derisive comments directed at his ex-lovers, including 'ukiachwa achika' and 'she said she want child support... nikamwambia nenda kwa RC'.

Zari however broke up with him on Valentine's Day after the musician cheated and sired a baby boy with Tanzanian video vixen and model Hamissa Mobetto. In releasing the passionate videos with his new catch, Diamond is making an attempt to win the bragging rights after being dumped. Zari denies knowing about Diamond's love affair with Hamisa Mobetto
