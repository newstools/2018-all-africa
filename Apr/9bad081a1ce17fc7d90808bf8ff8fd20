Diane Karusisi will continue to serve as the head of BK Group PLC, The New Times has learned. Karusisi is also the Chief Executive Officer of Bank of Kigali Ltd, a subsidiary of the Group. BK Group PLC was formed in December. Under the new structure, the Group operates as an investment company with three subsidiaries, namely; Bank of Kigali Ltd, BK General Insurance and BK TecHouse. Karusisi confirmed to this newspaper the board's decision to keep her at the helm of the Group. The decision was largely informed by the fact that the position is currently non-operating as all subsidiaries have respective heads and management, she said. BK General Insurance is headed by Alex Bahizi, while BK TecHouse is led by RÃ©gis Regemanshuro. The central bank had earlier advised the Group to separate the leadership of the Group and the bank's. BK Group PLC registered a net profit of Rwf23.3 billion last year which was an increase of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous year when they recorded Rwf20.8 billion in profit after tax.
