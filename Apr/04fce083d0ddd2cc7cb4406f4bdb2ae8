Kenyan songstress Vivian has come out to clear the air on her physique. The well-endowed entertainer said some people have been claiming that she has had butt enhancing implants. She refuted the claims on her Instagram page: "I love explaining who I really am coz half the time guys out here got some queer vibe like I got some implants on my back side haha acheni hizo bana." She is popular for her song Charm with Chameleon, Chingi Changa and Chum Chum. Vivian was betrothed to her fianc√© Sam at a traditional Kikuyu ceremony in March. Sam, who doubles up as her manager, proposed to the singer last year during an interview on live TV.
