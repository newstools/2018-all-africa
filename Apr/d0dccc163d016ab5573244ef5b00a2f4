The Constitution of Mauritius is now available in Braille. The new version was launched on Wednesday 11 April by Attorney General Maneesh Gobin at the Rajiv Gandhi Science Centre. In a statement, Gobin declared that "it is important that a citizen feels connected to his country" and that the Constitution is "the basic document that does so". The Attorney General added that with this new version of the Constitution, an even greater portion of the population would now have access to the supreme law of the land. Town and district councils have been supplied with Braille copies of the Constitution for general access at their respective public libraries. Braille was invented by Louis Braille in 1824. It is used by visually impaired people through a system of tactile writing on embossed paper.
