The Vision for Alternative Development (VALD) has commended government, Civil Society Organisations and the media for their continuous efforts towards the passage and adoption of the Tobacco Control Act, 2012 (Act 851) and the Tobacco Control Regulations (LI 2247) in 2016. Presenting a report in Accra, yesterday, on the study of the sale of single sticks of cigarette to children in Africa with a focus on Ghana, the Programs Director, Mr Labram Musah, indicated that the government, through the Ministries, Departments and Agencies banned the display, sale and smoking of tobacco in public places with the Foods and Drugs Authority ensuring that hotels and restaurants had a designated area for smokers. According to the report, Mr Musah said, although government was doing well, there was an urgent need for government to prohibit the sale of single sticks of cigarette to children in the country as it posed danger to their health and gave the youth the opportunity to experiment it making them grow to become addicts. The report, Mr Musah said, urged VALD, government and all relevant stakeholders to ensure that the aspect of the tobacco control laws and regulations protecting children were strictly adhered to while making sure that tobacco was not sold near educational institutions, hospitals and children's playing ground. He appealed to government to dedicate some funds for the implementation of the tobacco control laws, adding that with a collective effort by all individuals, Ghana could make tobacco control a national priority and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. In a statement, Mr Samuel Adams, Vice Chairman for Ghana Non-Communicable Diseases Alliance, noted that children were the future leaders of every country, hence the need to protect them from tobacco use as it was a risk factor to sixteen different kinds of cancers. Mr Adams called on all civil society organisations and government to collaborate in coming up with a pragmatic approach to deal with the menace and bring to book all perpetrators. Commenting on the report, Mr Archibald Adams, a Representative of the Civil Society sub-platform on Sustainable Development Goal three, expressed the hope that the findings from the report would be adopted by government and put to good use for the growth of Ghana and for the creation of a safe environment for the younger generation so that they would not be exposed to tobacco at a tender age.
