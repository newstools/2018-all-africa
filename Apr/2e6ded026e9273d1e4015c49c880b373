Seven people drowned after the vehicle they were travelling in was swept away by flood waters at Karati area in Kinangop on Saturday night. Four of the victims were from Maraigushu village in the outskirts of Naivasha town. They were headed to Munyaka village in Njabini when the driver of the Toyota Probox, who also perished in the incident, decided to drive through a flooded section of the road. NIGHTMARE A survivor, Paul Kariuki, says he miraculous escaped death. "I only have God to thank. The incident is still giving me nightmares," he said. Recalling the sequence of events, he said nine friends started the ill-fated journey around 9pm. "We had been invited to visit the home of one our friends. It happened so fast," said Mr Kariuki. He said the vehicle began to tip over as the water pushed it off the road. ESCAPE "The water was sweeping the car away but I managed to lower the car's window and get out. I sought assistance but it was not forthcoming," said Mr Kariuki. His colleagues who were still trapped in the vehicle made desperate attempts to save their lives but were so not lucky. Only one other person managed to escape. Speaking after she had condoled with the bereaved families, Naivasha MP Jayne Kihara termed the incident as a big loss. CAUTION "Losing seven people is a very painful experience. I urge the everyone to exercise caution during this rainy period," said the legislator. She promised to assist the bereaved families with burial arrangements but asked them to hold a joint ceremony. The bodies were taken to the Naivasha Sub-County Hospital mortuary. At least 15 people have been killed in rain-related incidents and about 2,000 displaced in several parts of the country in the past one week.
