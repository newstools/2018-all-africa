The Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission (SRCC) for Somalia, Ambassador Francisco Caetano Madeira, lauds the AU troops in Lower Shabelle region for the gallantry they displayed, during a confrontation with Al-Shabaab earlier Saturday. The troops fought off and successfully repulsed the terrorists who had launched simultaneous attacks on forwarding Operating Bases in Quoryole, Bulomareer, and Golwein. The militants were dealt a heavy blow, with at least 30 of them put out of action, following the intense fighting. Eight vehicles which ferried the terrorists, including two Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices, were destroyed and an assortment of weapons recovered. Unfortunately, AMISOM lost four gallant soldiers in the fighting. Six others sustained injuries. AMISOM pays tribute to these troops whose courage and sacrifice has frustrated Al-Shabaab's intent. "We honor our brave soldiers, who are resolute in continuing to neutralize the insurgents in order to restore peace and stability in Somalia," said Madeira.
