The national U-20 team coach, Vincent Mashami, has added three foreign-based players to the team that will face Kenya in the return leg of the 2019 Africa U20 Cup of Nations championship. Rwanda goes into the return leg on April 21 with a slight advantage after securing an away goal in the first leg last week in Machakos, Kenya. The three additions to the team include Uganda-based midfielder Azeedi Tumwine Mugabo, who joined the camp on Tuesday evening while Belgium-based defender Dylan Maes and winger Samuel Gueulette joined the team on Wednesday. Mugabo plays for the junior team of Uganda's top division side- Bul FC, Maes is part of Belgium's Waasland Beveren U-18 team while midfielder Gueulette plays for KAA Gent U-19 side, also in Belgium. The Junior Wasps began residential training on Monday and will play Zambia in the next round if they eliminate Kenya. The final qualifying round will be staged in July with the winner earning a slot to next year's Africa U-20 Cup of Nations finals tournament in Niger.
