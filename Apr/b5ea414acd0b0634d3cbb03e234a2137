Somali national army [SNA] has launched an operation aimed at rooting out Al Shabaab presence in the areas between Bal'ad and Jowhar towns in Middle Shabelle region. Speaking in an interview with Radio Shabelle, Qasim Ali Nur who is the commissioner of Bal'ad said the operation is jointly carried out by Somali forces backed by AU soldiers. The move came following series of Al Shabaab ambush attacks against Somali and AMISOM forces in the main road linking Bal'ad to Jowhar in the past few months. Nur said they want to enforce the security in the main street and prevent Al Shabaab from continuing the raids targeting the convoys of the allied troops. Al Shabaab has been driven out of a major ground in the region, but, the militant group is still capable of staging attacks, including roadside bombings and gun assault.
