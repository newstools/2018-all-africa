Michael Matthews' Five Fingers for Marseilles, starring Vuyo Dabula, made a thunderous debut at the box office, opening with more than half a million in ticket sales. The film has outperformed past South African favourites in the action/crime/drama genres, with a showing that was 28% stronger than Inumber Number (2013), 31% stronger than Jerusalema (2008), 34% higher than Noem My Skollie (2016) and 40% higher than Hard to Get (2014) on its opening weekend. "We had high expectations for the film," says Helen Kuun, MD of Indigenous Film Distribution. "We always knew it was something special from the first screenings. It's all about great storytelling thanks to Sean Drummond's impressive script, and the film's spectacular cast." As a result of the positive response to the film, it will be screened at four additional sites this week to meet public demand - at Festival Mall in Pretoria, and at Sandton City, Vaal Mall in Vanderbijlpark and Mimosa Mall in Bloemfontein. Five Fingers for Marseilles will also be releasing in the USA on 7 September, starting in New York and Los Angeles, and then moving to an additional 15 American cities. Source: Supplied
