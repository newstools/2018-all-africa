Mogadishu â€” THE African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is reviewing its information and communications technology (ICT) capabilities to enhance effectiveness. A team of 39 ICT services executives from the mission is undertaking a technical and asset review exercise for the organisation's infrastructure. The three-day review workshop, which opened on Monday, aims to improve communication systems and secure networks in the force. "For any peace support operations to function effectively, or any other operation, military command and control depends on a complex communication network of equipment, personnel and communication protocols to relay information among forces," said Major General Charles Tai Gituai, AU Mission's Deputy Force Commander In-charge of Operations and Planning. While highlighting the importance of information and communication technology, in the success of any peacekeeping mission, he called for more robust methods of communications, that adequately addresses the needs of the force and strengthens its effectiveness in the fight against terrorists. "And this calls for well-established communication systems that enhances cohesive, flexible and secure communication networks," Gituai emphasised. The UN Support Office in Somalia (UNSOS) will during the review evaluate and identify gaps that might impede the AU mission's work. UNSOS' support to AMISOM includes the provision of, and management of ICT facilities and equipment. The equipment provided by UNSOS range from secure email facilities, radio communication equipment, internet connectivity, satellite phones, asset management and maintenance of the communication infrastructure. AMISOM was deployed in 2007 to support Somalia's forces in their battle against Al-Shabaab militants.
