Local comedian and host of The Daily Show Trevor Noah launched the Trevor Noah Foundation on Wednesday. The Trevor Noah Foundation is a non-profit organisation that equips orphans and vulnerable youth with the education, life skills, and social capital necessary to pursue further opportunity after graduating high school or matric. Announcing the initiative at a press conference, which was live-streamed on Facebook, he says: "Fundamentally it is an organisation that is initially going to focus primarily on education. Figuring out how to bridge the gap between a child and the education that we feel that they deserve." He adds:"Figuring out how to bridge the gap between educational institutions and the funding that we feel that they deserve. Figuring out how to bridge the gap between the education that learners get at the jobs that we feel that they deserve. Because all of these are pieces that need to work together, in order for us to move forward." Trevor was joined by South African and close friend Anele Mdoda. Source: The Juice
