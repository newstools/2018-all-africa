Socialite Vera Sidika elated a section of her fans over the week by showing off a baby bump and posting ultra sound photos of her 'pregnancy'. In a series of posts, the socialite claimed that keeping the pregnancy under wraps was proving difficult and felt compelled to be the first to share the news to her fans. "My doctor makes house calls because walking into a hospital without being recognized would have been impossible. Keeping up with social media has become a myth because my growing tummy will be a topic so I had to stay off Snapchat, post old photos on IG, to avoid suspicions. I always wanted to have a baby before I hit 30. I'm turning 29 this September and this was the perfect timing. I'm very grateful and the happiest I've ever been in my life. But kept it lowkey cause I wanted a stress free journey," Yesterday, I got a call from a media house informing me that they received an anonymous tip, that I was pregnant and asking me to confirm or deny. I refused to comment and they told me that they'll publish the story in the coming week. I knew they would publish the rumours with or without my confirmation and realized that I can't hide for too long. I honestly thought I possibly could but it's hell. Your movements are limited and very difficult especially being a public figure. My doctor makes house calls cause walking into a hospital without being recognized would have been impossible 😩 keeping up with social media has become a myth because my growing tummy will be a topic 😩 so I had to stay off Snapchat, post old photos on IG, To avoid suspicions. I always wanted to have a baby before I hit 30. I'm turning 29 this September and this was the perfect timing. I'm very grateful and the happiest I've ever been in my life. But kept it lowkey cause I wanted a stress free journey. Away from paparazzi and nosey people. But we can't control the media. Somehow they always get to find out and beat us on our own game. So just before you read it from the blogs, this is me confirming, I am pregnant and just can't wait to have my bundle of joy. I feel so blessed 🙏🤰 Cant wait for my gender reveal/announcement party 🎉😁 P.S; I'll share videos of my journey so far. This coming week.
