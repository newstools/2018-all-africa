Tobacco is the country's most valuable export commodity - generating US$933.7 million in 2016 - and the crop is particularly significant to Zimbabwean authorities' efforts to revive the economy. However, Human Rights Watch research in 2016 and 2017 into conditions on tobacco farms in Zimbabwe reveals an industry tainted by child labour and confronted by other serious human rights problems as well.
