A non-governmental organisation is searching for 100 brave men willing to undergo vasectomy during this year's World Vasectomy Day (WVD). Family Health Options Kenya (FHOK) will mark the day with a four-day vasectomy campaign in Nairobi to be held from Monday. The day is marked worldwide to encourage men share responsibility in family planning. In 2016, 74 Nairobi men underwent the chop as part of the celebrations held at the Kenyan National Theater. This year's campaign will be held at Family Health Options Kenya (FHOK) clinic in Phoenix House, located on Kenyatta Avenue. The vasectomies will be free of charge. "The challenge is real, but working as one, we are confident we will find the 100 heroes in Kenya," the organization said in a statement. 'MAN OF THE YEAR' Among those to attend will be George Mbogah, winner of WVD's Man of the Year award for 2016, who did his vasectomy six years ago. "It is now almost six years since I had my vasectomy and I no longer fear the financial burden of more children nor the well-being of my wife due to multiple pregnancies. I might have been amongst the first men to choose this path, but we are now hundreds and growing," said Mbogah. Vasectomy is a surgical procedure for male sterilization or permanent contraception. During the procedure, the male ducts (called vas deferens) are cut and tied or sealed so as to prevent sperm from leaving the penis. It's usually carried out under local anesthetic, where you are awake but don't feel any pain, and takes about 15 minutes. In rare cases, you may have a general anesthetic, where you're asleep during the operation.
