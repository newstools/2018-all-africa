Top Tanzanian artiste Alikiba has been hogging all the showbiz headlines since it emerged that he is set to marry his Kenyan girlfriend, Amina Rikesh. At first, news of the wedding was merely a speculation, but the big day is finally here with the couple set to tie the knot today (Thursday) at Diamond Jubilee Hall in Kongwea, Mombasa County. While Alikiba needs no introduction, not much is known about his fianc√©e, Amina. This is largely due to the fact that bride and groom managed to keep their relationship off the limelight, the Tanzanian artiste's high profile notwithstanding. Since 2016 when the two started dating, only a few photos of the love birds have been shared online. After today's wedding in Mombasa, a second wedding will be held on April 29 in Dar es Salaam with former Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete among the invited guests.
