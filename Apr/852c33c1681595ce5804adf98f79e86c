South African rapper Riky Rick on Saturday announced that he was taking a break from making music and performing with a series of tweets. The artist also deleted all of his photos off of his Instagram account. THE TWEETS READ IN FULL: "Friends & fam, I apologise sincerely to everybody who will be effected but I am not in the right place mentally to continue doing shows or anything that involves leaving my children. "I am taking time to find my faith before I lose the connection with the people I love the most. Being a 'celebrity' it's difficult to tell people I ain't feeling well. "It's difficult to take time away because people expect you to be superhuman. I am not superhuman. I'm just another human being who wants to find some sort of peace and happiness in life. I'm sorry. I love you guys. See you later, maybe. (sic)" This break follows the popular performer telling Channel24 Music in March' "Right now, I'm trying to break new ground and do things that people have never done in our space."
