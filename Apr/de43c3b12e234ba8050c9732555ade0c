Zimbabwe-focused gold miner, Caledonia, says it anticipates an increase in income during the current financial year, driven by a 7,5 percentage point increase in export incentives paid to gold miners by the central bank. The New York and Canadian Stock Exchange-listed firm's chief executive officer, Steve Curtis, yesterday said the additional income projection was based on the assumption that the gold price would remain at $1 260 per ounce this year.
