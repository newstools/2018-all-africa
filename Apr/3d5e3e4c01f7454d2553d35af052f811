South Africa's afro-fusion music band will make a return to the Harare International Festival of the Arts after brushes with Zimbabwe immigration authorities saw them fail to make it twice before. In October 2010, the Immigration Department denied the group work permits, forcing them to cancel their show in Harare. In 2014, the group was turned back after landing in Harare, ruining a hugely anticipated performance at the festival. The group was accused of mocking former president Robert Mugabe for hanging on to power in their video, Chicken to Change. The festival kicks off on 1st of May up to the 6th.
