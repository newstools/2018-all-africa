On this score, he made an appeal to the population to double their efforts and to adopt a sense of ownership for the preservation, conservation and restoration of our rich cultural heritage and to pass on this rich culture to the future generations. The Minister also called for the collaboration of the private sector to participate actively in the preservation of the cultural and natural heritage.
