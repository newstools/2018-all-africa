Somalia National Army (SNA) backed by African Union forces recaptured new villages in Hiiraan region of central Somalia from Al Shabaab on Tuesday. Mohamed Nur Agajof, a military spokesperson in the region, told Radio Shabelle that the allied troops gained control of areas located between Beledweyne, Mahas and Mataban. The takeover came after a joint offensive against the militant group of Al-Shabaab, the official added. He said the operation will continue until the whole areas still under Al-Shabaab control are liberated. Al Shabaab is yet to comment on the assault and the latest development.
