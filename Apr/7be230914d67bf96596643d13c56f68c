The Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC) is planning to nearly double diamond production this year, after production reached 751 303 carats in the first quarter. In 2016, ZCDC produced 965 000 carats despite limited capacity and poor access to mining concessions. This was doubled to 1,8 million carats in 2017 after improved operational efficiency and production effectiveness, ZCDC chief executive officer, Morris Mpofu, said.
