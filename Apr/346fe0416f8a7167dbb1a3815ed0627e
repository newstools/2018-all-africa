Minna â€” Over 20 communities in Munya council area of Niger State have pleaded with the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai, to extend the deadline for the withdrawal of military personnel deployed to quell the incessant cases of kidnapping and robbery in the area. The residents said they were not yet safe. The appeal comes in the wake of a directive for the troops to return to their barracks today. The senator representing Niger East in the National Assembly, David Umaru, who addressed a press conference on behalf of the people in Minna, said the presence of the soldiers had made the people live peacefully without any molestation from the hoodlums. He commended the cordial relationship between the people and the troops while the operation lasted. Umaru noted that since the deployment, no attack had been recorded, expressing the fear that the demobilisation might endanger the prevailing peace in the area.

"We appeal to the Chief of Army staff to please allow the soldiers to stay a little longer. We are making this appeal because we know that the troops have the capacity to defend our people." He disclosed that prior to the mobilisation of the soldiers, the poor farmers were made to pay as much as N4 million as ransom for kidnapped relatives. Umaru continued: "You can imagine when these poor farmers are forced to sell their unripe farm produce, houses and other things to pay ransom."
