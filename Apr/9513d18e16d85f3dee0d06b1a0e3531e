Flamboyant businessman and the new face on Zimbabwe gig promoters block, Genius 'Ginimbi' Kadungure has revealed that his debut concert that featured Nigerian superstar, Davido did not yield much profit as he expected. The gig which he hosted in partnership with 2Kings saw up to 8 000 people, according to Ginimbi, thronging the venue to watch the long awaited second coming of 'Fia' hit-maker in Zimbabwe. Speaking to 263Chat, Kadungure said though good numbers attended the concert, exchange rates of bond notes to foreign currencies left them with not so huge profits. "Well marates emari ndiwo akazoita kuti tisaite profit hombe, ukatarisa marates achona unozongosarawo hako ungori bho but not stereki," said Ginimbi. He added that he was happy with his first all white party in Zimbabwe, promising more now that he is home. "I'm here now, I'm home and going nowhere, so do expect more all white parties here," added Ginimbi. Meanwhile the VVIP section turned into a women's Wrestlemania ring with short video clips of countless fights making rounds on social media.
