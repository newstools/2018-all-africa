Botswana's peaceful transition of power, economic and political stability has made it a beacon of hope on the continent, admired and envied by many. This week the country witnessed the swearing in of its fifth president, 55-year-old Mokgweetsi Masisi who took over from Ian Khama. Botswana is lauded as the exemplary democratic and stable country on the continent other countries should admired and follow. It is the least corrupt country in Africa, with the best police force and the rule of law is upheld in the country. Most importantly, the country's political stability has been a positive story of self-rule in Africa. After serving for two terms, Botswana's President Ian Khama stepped down and handed over power to Mokgweetsi Masisi his Vice President. President Khama, 65 years old when compared to many other African presidents, is quite young. His successor President Masisi, 55, was sworn as the new president of the country. Although elections are scheduled for October 2019, Masisi will serve as acting president until elections take place. On his Twitter page, President Masisi promised to diversify the economy and tackle unemployment among the youths. President Masisi also said he was delighted to be the first president to be sworn in with a mother to witness the event. President Masisi is a former teacher, a UNICEF employee and an Education Minister, and previously he was Minister of Presidential Affairs and Public Administration from 2011 to 2014. He was first elected into parliament in 2009 and comes from a family with a long history in public service. His father was an MP and a cabinet minister in Seretse Khama's government. Botswana is one of the few countries undergoing a leadership transition. For the past few months, some African countries have been undergoing leadership transitions, from Zimbabwe, Liberia to Ethiopia. The quest for young people to take over power is gaining currency and momentum.
