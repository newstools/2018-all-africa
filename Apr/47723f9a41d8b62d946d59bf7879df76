Dar es Salaam â€” The Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) announced today April 10 that it has collected a total of Sh11.78 trillion in the first three quarters of 2017/18 financial year. According to TRA, this denotes 8.46 percent improvement compared to collections recorded in the similar period in 2016/17. The TRA Director of tax payer services and education, Mr Richard Kayombo, said Sh10.86 trillion were collected in first nine months of 2016/17. Mr Kayombo attributed this relatively good performance to the commitment of the taxman and various leaders. He also linked the performance to the increased taxpayers' compliance. He also expressed his optimism that the revenue collection will increase once the taxman completes registration of new taxpayers mainly from the informal sector.
