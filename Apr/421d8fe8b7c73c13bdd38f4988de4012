Nyala â€” A huge fire that broke out at the market of El Salam camp for the displaced near the South Darfur capital of Nyala, has destroyed more than 450 shops. "The fire erupted at the market at 3 am on Friday. Because of the strong wind, the flames could spread rapidly," one of the victims told Radio Dabanga. "More than 450 shops were destroyed, including groceries, perfume shops, shops selling building materials, in addition to restaurants, cafeterias, and a number of stores." The losses that were being counted on Friday afternoon are estimated at tens of thousands of Sudanese Pounds. The source said that most camp residents suspect arson. "They say the authorities are behind the fire. The government wants to impoverish the displaced as they intend to dismantle the camp".
