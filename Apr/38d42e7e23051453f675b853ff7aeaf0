Nairobi â€” President Uhuru Kenyatta will on Tuesday visit the London Stock exchange for a meeting with investors, using the event to share areas of investment opportunity in terms of his Big Four agenda, as well as job creation. The Head of State who arrived in the UK on Monday evening will also deliver an address at Chatham House, the shrine for policy and investment thinkers in London. His speech will dwell on Kenya's efforts in achieving inclusive growth, the positive role Kenya is playing in supporting regional peace, and its station in a globalising world.
