The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) condemns the senseless attacks on law enforcement officials. Recently there has been an unacceptable increase in the number of officers being attacked on and off duty. On Wednesday, 4 April 2018, a JMPD officer inspector Ayanda Zulu was shot dead at the gate of her residential place in Palm Springs. The RTMC sends heartfelt condolences to the Zulu family and friends. In a separate incident this weekend, an officer was abducted and shot by armed thugs in Khuvhi village. Inspector Shirindi was trying to stop a suspicious vehicle that failed to stop at an intersection. The officer managed to stop the vehicle but was held at gunpoint and placed in the boot of the vehicle. The thugs also ran off with a state vehicle, which was later recovered at a nearby village. The officer was also found shot and dumped at Phiphidi village and was rushed to Pholoso Hospital where he is recuperating. The RTMC urges law enforcement agencies to speed up the investigations and to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book. Furthermore, members of the public who might have information regarding these attacks are requested to report it to the relevant authorities. Issued by: Road Traffic Management Corporation
