ABAX is looking forward to seeing its partners at the next conference of the African Capital and Venture Capital Association (AVCA), held in Marrakech from April 22-26. A member of AVCA since 2012, the international provider of fiduciary, advisory and business services based in Mauritius, will be represented by Nousrath Bhugeloo, partner and head of international business development. “We strive to regularly participate in this meeting, explains Ms. Bhugeloo. This gives us the opportunity to meet many players interested in the financial flows towards and out of emerging countries, which has been our core business since our inception. Each year we understand the need to engage more with Africa-focused private equity funds in various African countries, as welle as with African business leaders, especially family-owned SMEs, whom we help improving their governance structure, either for their accounting methods or their decision-making process.” This year, ABAX participation is particularly important in a number of ways. This will be used to present the different opportunities stemming from our recent rapprochement with international group OCORIAN. Moreover, in Marrakech, the recent developments of activities associating the international financial centers of Port-Louis and Casablanca, two essential gateways for Afirca, will undoubtedly also be a particularly relevant topic.
