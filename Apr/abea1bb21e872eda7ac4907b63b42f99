Speaking before the parliamentary committee that oversees the Interior ministry, Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has defended the second deportation of the self-declared "general" of the National Resistance Movement, Miguna Miguna, after his refusal to produce his passport when he landed at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport from Canada. Miguna was forced to leave the country for his participation in National Super Alliance leader Railla Odinga's swearing-in as the "People's President". Matiang'i maintains Miguna was not deported, but removed as an undocumented person.
