The Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Tukur Buratai yesterday inaugurated a panel to investigate allegations against the Nigerian Army during military operations in Taraba State. The Chief of Army Staff, who inaugurated the 10 man committee at the Army headquarters, Abuja charged the panel to unravel, the true situation of things. The panel headed by Major General Joseph Nimyel (rtd) is expected to submit its report within ten days. It would be recalled that a former minister of defence, Lt Gen Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma (rtd) had accused the military of colluding with armed bandits in carrying out killings in parts of the country. The retired Army chief had also called on people to embark on self defence. The panel was mainly mandated to ascertain the veracity of Danjuma's accusation. Other members of the committee are; Brig. General Saka Abubakar (rtd) Brig. General Sani Mohammed, Brig. General Kayode Olajide, Brig. General Alexander Ridley and Brig. General Stanley Eze. The rest are, Abdul Atadoga Ibrahim of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Mrs Comfort Davut of the Civil Society Organisation, Abdulrahman Yakubu of the National Human Right Commission and Col Gambo Mohammed. Buratai later met with the Chief of Staff to the President, Malam Abba Kyari, behind closed-doors at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja. The army chief did not disclose what he and Kyari discussed when approached by State House correspondents.
