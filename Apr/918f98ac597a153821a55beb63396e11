Effective from the group stages, CAF Interclub competitions will witness a new identity regarding the broadcast of the matches with dedicated days and kick-off times. Following the approval of the CAF Interclub Committee, the Total CAF Champions League will henceforth be played on Friday and Saturday for weekend matches and Tuesday for mid-week matches. Sundays have been reserved for the Total CAF Confederation Cup and Wednesday for the mid-week games. CAF General Secretary, Amr Fahmy, said the decision is towards creating a stronger identity for the Club competitions, exposure, marketable and accessible to a wider global audience. "We strongly believe in having a unique identity for the club competitions and also creating a rendezvous for the fans, a major stakeholder to identify with the two competitions. It will also increase the number of matches broadcasted by the TV Rights Holders. "There will be a few exceptions in some special cases since it is a novelty. However, we are hopeful it will mark a giant leap for our club competitions," Fahmy said.
