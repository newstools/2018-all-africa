The Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) has banned a film titled 'Rafiki'. KFCB chief executive Ezekiel Mutua said the agency banned the film because it contains homosexual scenes which he said is illegal in Kenya. Rafiki, which means "friend" in Kiswahili, tells the story of two young women who fall in love. The film, directed by Wanuri Kahiu is set to premiere at this yearâ€™s 71st Cannes Film Festival next month. It is the first Kenyan feature film to receive such an invitation from the biggest and most prestigious film festival in the world.
