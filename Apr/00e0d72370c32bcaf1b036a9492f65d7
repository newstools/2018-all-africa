LIVESTOCK, crop and vegetable farmers at Otjiwarongo are thrilled with the good rainfalls received recently. A technician at the ministry of agriculture, Saima Nambuli, said about 100 millimetres have been recorded from March to the beginning of April this year. She told Nampa on enquiry yesterday that in January and February 2018, rainfall of 27 mm and 59 mm in the Otjiwarongo district was recorded, compared to the 93 mm in March alone, and 5 mm so far in April. "The sky also continues to promise more rain, and we hope it rains until the middle of April," Nambuli said. A goat and cattle farmer outside Otjiwarongo, Ludwig Tjirare, yesterday told this news agency that his livestock had picked up weight in March alone as grass has grown to above knee level in some portions of his grazing land. "It is a good feeling as a farmer. I had been worried since December 2017 after it failed to rain well and the grass on my farmland was stuck at merely one centimetre." Tjirare said if the rain continues until mid-April, his livestock will survive and multiply well this whole year. A crop and vegetable farmer at the Otjiveg fields, Hendrick Morosi, said he is excited about the rains received in the area so far, especially after the drought experienced in 2013, 2014 and 2015. "It had been difficult for my maize crop, sweet potatoes and sunflower to grow well and fig trees to bear fruit during the past three years," he noted. Morosi hopes for a bumper harvest at the end of April. Owner of the TW Tulongeni Fruit and Vegetable field, Werner Hamukwaya, said the rainfall had restored hope for a good harvest from his maize field, orange trees and the variety of vegetables. "I am really happy about my crops. They have started to grow well and bear fruit," he said. - Nampa
