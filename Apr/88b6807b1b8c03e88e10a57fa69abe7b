April is Jazz Month, and the best time to unveil "Afrika Unite"! Afrika Unite is a musical collaboration between the Nairobi Horns Project (NHP) and Africa Plus from South Africa. After making a connection at the Safaricom International Jazz Festival and several conversations later, this continent's most eclectic bands come together with the purpose of sharing musical ideas and experiences, creating original content, joint performances and enhancing collaborations. As part of this collaboration, a series of one-of-a-kind musical experience in Nairobi for the avid lover of good music, will be coming your way later this month. On April 27th, NHP will feature award-winning vocalist Silayio, who is fresh from her forays on The Voice Holland and a new release of her song Gimme More Love. NHP will also be collaborating with South African brothers; Drummer Lelo Mazibuko and Pianist/Producer Luyanda Madope who bring a wide selection of styles, tastes and eclecticism that has come to characterize and define the sound from the South. NHP will host a May Day Concert, which is a fusion between Kenyan Pop, Jazz, and African Rhythms - featuring performances by Nameless, Shamsi Music, Lelo & Luyanda and Silayio. For the first time, Nameless performs alongside NHP and it will be super interesting to see how the collaboration of styles and genres pan out. The NHP crew will also be teaming-up with Jeff Koinange and his efforts towards the Jeff Koinange Library at the new Mbagathi Girls High School. This concert will spotlight the amazing work happening here, as well as assist in raising money towards equipping this new Library. For more information head to https://www.facebook.com/nairobihorns/
