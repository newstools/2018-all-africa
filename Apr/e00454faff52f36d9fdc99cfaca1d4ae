The federal government has urged Nigerians to take proactive measures that will end plastic pollution and protect the planet. The Minister of State for Environment, Ibrahim Jibril, gave the advice in a statement issued in Abuja on Sunday by his media aide, Esther Agbarakwe, to mark the 2018 World Earth Day. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the 2018 Earth Day marked on April 22, has the theme "End Plastic Pollution." "Nigerians are urged to use the weekend to celebrate the planet and to take action to protect it by ending plastic pollution. "Plastic pollution is poisoning our oceans and land, injuring marine life, and affecting our health," he said. According to him, government is exploring the possibility of banning plastic bags with availability of alternatives. "We are encouraging household and community recycling of plastic bottles as a matter community action and of state legislation "Unless we take these steps, the problem is not going away says Dr Cristiana Pa≈üca Palmer, the Executive Secretary of The UN Convention On Biological Diversity in a message. "In 1950, the world's population of 2.5 billion produced 1.5 million tonnes of plastic; in 2016, a global population of more than seven billion people produced over 300 million tonnes of plastic," the minister said. According to him, plastic pollution is now an ever-present challenge. "We can see plastics floating in our rivers, ocean, and lagoons, littering our landscapes and affecting our health, and the future of billions of children and youths.
