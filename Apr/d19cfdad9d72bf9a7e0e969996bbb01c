Victoria Falls will soon boast a new luxury boutique called Mbano Manor Hotel, set to be launched in the first half of 2019. The Mbano Manor Hotel's vision is to cater for the top-end of the international market with an upmarket in a forest setting only four kilometres away from the world-famous landmark.
