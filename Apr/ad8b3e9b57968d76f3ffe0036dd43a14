Private Sector Federation on Saturday paid tribute to business leaders from eastern part of the country killed during the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. The commemorative event was held at Mwulire memorial in Rwamagana District, Eastern Province. Mwulire memorial site is home to 26,851 Genocide victims. More than a million people lost their lives during the Genocide. "About 95 per cent of Genocide perpetrators were members of the private sector, while a vast majority of the victims were also in the private sector, especially in agriculture," said Jean Bosco Ndungutse, the chairman of PSF in Eastern Province. During the event, members of the federation gave a cow to a vulnerable Genocide survivor from each of the districts constituting the province, a gesture they said will boost beneficiaries' self-sufficiency. "This is an act of humanity," said Eastern Province Governor Fred Mufulukye in appreciation of the support extended to the survivors. The business leaders also hailed the gains the country has since made in private sector, especially in the area of ease of doing business. They said that with all the necessities in place for businesses it is now their turn to make a meaningful contribution toward the country's development.
