Mines Minister Winston Chitando has defended Russian-linked coal miner, Liberation Mining's operations in the Gwayi River basin after a legislator raised concerns over possible acid contamination in water bodies. The mine, which recently received an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) certificate from the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), has been running pilot operations at its Gwayi concession in Lupane District, Matabeleland North Province.
