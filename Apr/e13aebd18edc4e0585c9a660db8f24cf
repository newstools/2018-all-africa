Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko last born daughter Sandra Mbuvi has excited the online community with pictures of her birthday party held over the weekend. Sandra wore a sash and crown made of replicas of currency notes. The pictures, shared by her big sister Saumu Mbuvi, show the birthday girl draped in a blue fitting gown holding a fan and a small basket covered in replicas of different denominations. "Had so much fun at my sister's birthday, #partyoftheyear," captioned Saumu. The lavish event attended by close friends and family comes only three weeks after the Mbuvi's splashed money for the celebration of Saumu's daughter first birthday celebration.
