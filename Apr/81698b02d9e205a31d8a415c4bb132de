A MAN died yesterday after being diagnosed with Congo fever at the Windhoek Central Hospital. Health minister Bernard Haufiku confirmed the death in a statement issued yesterday. Haufiku said the 37-year-old victim, who has not been identified, had assisted a neighbour with slaughtering a cow that was infested with ticks on 21 March in the Keetmanshoop area. He later fell ill and was transferred to the Windhoek Central Hospital on 30 March. The minister added that the case can be regarded as an outbreak, according to the World Health Organisation's guidelines. //Karas regional health director Bartholomeus Muntenda told The Namibian this week that about 40 people suspected of having been in contact with the victim were placed under quarantine. According to the ministry of health, Congo fever is transmitted mainly through tick bites, handling or working with an infected animal's blood, and can also be transmitted from one infected person to another by contact with infectious blood or body fluids.
