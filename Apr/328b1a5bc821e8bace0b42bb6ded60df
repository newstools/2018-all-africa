Maseru â€” AT least 12 people have been killed and several children injured following heavy rains and floods in Lesotho. More than 1 400 people, or 315 households, have been left homeless. Public infrastructure worth 4 million Maloti (R4, million) and R1,5 million worth of crops have been damaged. The heavy rains, hailstorms and flash floods have been experienced in 23 villages in Mafeteng, Quthing and Thaba-Tseka districts since March. According to Lesotho Meteorological Services, the districts recorded and exceeded their monthly average rainfall in February and March 2018. Houses, vehicles, roads along with five schools and one health centre as well as various summer crops have been destroyed. According to the rapid assessment undertaken by the Disaster Management, golf ball-sized hailstones, have been blamed for the deaths of people and animals as well as damage to infrastructure. The destruction of farmlands could result in a subsequent food insecurity to most of the households in the Southern African country in the coming months, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network has warned. In Lesotho, annual variance in rainfall is erratic, which leads to periodic droughts in the dry season from May to September. Flooding can be severe in the rainy season between October and April.
