//Karas health directorate has confirmed that a resident of Keetmanshoop, living at the town's Ilenie informal settlement, was tested positive for symptoms of Congo fever, and that about 40 people suspected of having been in contact with him were placed under quarantine. Regional health director Barthlomeus Muntenda yesterday said the man was admitted to the Windhoek State Hospital, and described his medical condition as stable. "The suspected case was confirmed on Saturday," he said. He said the man last week sought medical assistance at the Keetmanshoop State Hospital, but medical examinations conducted on him did no show any signs of Congo fever. But Muntenda said when the man's health condition deteriorated, he was transferred to the Windhoek State Hospital where additional tests done on him indicated that he was infected with the disease caused by a tick-borne virus. The regional director said the origin of the infection is still being investigated, and that preliminary investigations show that the man had been slaughtering livestock with other people. There is no need for panic or alarm, said Muntenda, urging the public to immediately seek for medical assistance when they show any signs of fever. "This disease can kill, but it can be treated if symptoms are detected early," he warned. He said those identified as having been in contact with the man were barred from leaving the Keetmanshoop health district, and are being closely monitored by officials. "We have also told them to avoid body contact with other residents," the regional health director added. According to Muntenda, the health ministry is expected to make an announcement on the confirmed case in question today.
