The U.S.$100 million project will be executed by the Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute in collaboration with other global environment and wildlife conservation organisations. During this process, 3,000 to 3,500 satellite images will be collected and experts from the UK-based Glasgow University will count them digitally under the supervision of three professors. The same satellite images will be dispatched to scientists worldwide for experts to make their voluntary counting.
