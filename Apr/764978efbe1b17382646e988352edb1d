Cape Town â€” CAPE Town, the drought-stricken South African city, is gearing up to host the world's premiere conference on climate change adaptation. This is the first time in its ten-year history that Adaptation Futures will be taking place in Africa. To be held on June 18-21 under the theme, "Dialogues for Solutions," it will bring together over 1 000 researchers, policymakers, businesspeople, international funders from over 80 countries to share their latest climate adaptation research, discuss how cities, countries and communities can best adapt to climate change, and forge new policies and partnerships. The African Climate and Development Initiative (ACDI) is the main conference organiser. "I'm really excited to see the mix of new research, practical experience and critical reflection on progress to date that will be covered during the conference," says ACDI director and chairperson of the conference steering committee Mark New. "Given the impacts of climate and weather on society that we've seen in the last couple of years, there is no better time and place for Adaptation Futures 2018 to be taking place." Cape Town is still enduring the effects of its worst drought in over a century.
