MOST of Namibia's major surface water reservoirs have not had their levels boosted by the past week of widespread rains over the country and are still emptier now than they had been at the same stage of the rainy season a year ago. The only dams where some inflows of water were recorded over the past week are the Omatako and Von Bach dams, from which Windhoek receives water, the Naute Dam near Keetmanshoop, and the Olushandja Dam in northern Namibia, the Namibia Water Corporation's latest weekly dam bulletin, which was released yesterday, indicates. The Omatako Dam received an inflow of more than 2,3 million cubic metres of water since the start of last week, raising its level from 4,5% of its full capacity on Monday last week to 10% yesterday. The volume of water stored in the Olushandja Dam rose by 1,7 million cubic metres over the past week, resulting in an increase of the dam's level from 26% of its full capacity at the start of last week to 30,2% yesterday. With an inflow of 0,4 million cubic metres of water, the Naute Dam's level rose from 70,6% on Monday last week to 71% yesterday, while the Von Bach Dam received 0,39 million cubic metres of water, bringing its level to 52,7% yesterday (51,9% a week earlier). Dam levels reported by NamWater yesterday, compared to the same dams' levels a year ago, are: 3 April 2018 3 April 2017 Hardap 46,4% 70,4% Naute 71% 98,6% Swakoppoort 36,8% 35,8% Von Bach 52,7% 57,9% Omatako 10% 55,9% Oanob 66,8% 89,3% Olushandja 30,2% 47% Otjivero Main 10,2% 27,3% Otjivero Silt empty 1,9% Tilda Viljoen 34,2% 28,9% Daan Viljoen 24,2% 32,6% Dreihuk 8,1% 26,8% Bondels empty 47,6% Omaruru Delta empty 3,7%
