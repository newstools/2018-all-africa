Organisers of the much anticipated live performance of hip hop star Rick Ross in Nairobi have denied rumors circulating on social media about the rapper's raft of demands ahead of the concert. Rich Ross is rumoured to have demanded for, among other things, a helicopter and 3,500 bootles of premium alcohol. NRG Wave, organisers of the concert, on Tuesday urged fans to ignore the claims and instead get ready for the event set for next weekend. "NRGWave is urging the public to disregard the Rock Ross rider doing rounds online ahead of the concert scheduled for the 28 April at the Carnivore," read the statement.

Further, organisers were to provide a helicopter for interview appearances on various television stations and transportation to the concert venue. It also claimed that Rick Ross had demanded 3,500 bottles of Luc Belaire bottles, 1,500 fresh white towels and 200 bottles of lemon flavoured sparkling water. Two major Nairobi roads were also to be closed shortly before, during and shortly after the concert. "The article misrepresents the terms of the contract we signed with Boss management team. Rick Ross is ready to meet Bosses and Ballers at Carnivore for a mega Boss Party with Rozay at the second edition of #NRGWave," the organisers said in their statement
