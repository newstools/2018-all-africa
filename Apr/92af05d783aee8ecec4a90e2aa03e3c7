With barely few weeks to the commencement of the group stages of the CAF Interclub competitions, inspection missions to the match venues and facilities of the participating teams has been concluded. This follows the approval of the CAF Executive Committee at its meeting on 10 January 2018 in Casablanca, Morocco, to organise inspection visits to match venues of the qualified clubs of the Total CAF Champions League 2018, to ensure that the facilities meet the minimum CAF standards. The exercise supervised by experienced CAF Instructors commenced in early April 2018 with emphasis on the following; 1. Main stadium of each qualified team 2. Alternate match venues in the country of each club 3. Training pitches 4. Accommodation (Hotels) 5. Medical (Hospitals, Emergency Centres, etc) "It is the first time such inspections have been carried out and the response has been positive. The exercise was to ensure that the matches are hosted in venues with the basic requirements in accordance with the Club Licensing System taking into consideration broadcast needs, media and safety of fans," said CAF General Secretary Amr Fahmy. In a related development, a similar inspection will be conducted for the group stage participants of the Total CAF Confederation Cup 2018 ahead of the Day One matches on Sunday, 6 May 2018.
