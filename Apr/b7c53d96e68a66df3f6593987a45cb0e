A "Media Leaders' Summit for Asia" held in China's Hainan Province recently. Media men from around the world have signed bilateral and multilateral agreements in China's Hainan provincial capital, Sanya, to promote cooperation and mutual development. Over 300 representatives from around the world, including more than 140 media leaders from over 40 Asian countries and regions, and 44 African and Asia Pacific journalists, attended the event. The theme was "A New Era of Media Cooperation in Asia: Interconnectivity and Innovative Development." Dubbed the "Media Leaders' Summit for Asia," the signing took place a day to the opening of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2018 attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Media professionals were urged to take great responsibility, create favourable atmosphere for the stable and high-quality development of Asia and the world, promote innovation and cooperation, and focus on common interests for the development of their nations. Participants were also requested to tell positive stories about Asia's innovations and creations, and international win-win cooperation so as to play an optimistic role in promoting a better world. Huang Kunming, Head of the Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, highlighted the vivid innovation stories of Asian people and the need to share them to help make the spirit of innovation part of Asian popular culture. The Summit comprised four panel sessions: "Media Exchanges and Cooperation for Assistance in Building a Community of the Shared Future," "Building One Belt, One Road and New Opportunities for International communications," "40 Years of Reform and Opening-up: China Development and Global Opportunities," and "Kaleidoscope of Asian Cultures: Exchanges and Mutual Knowledge."
