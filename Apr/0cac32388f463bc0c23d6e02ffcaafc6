Addis Ababa â€” Close to 4,000 Chinese passengers use the Ethiopian airline's flight services on a daily basis, the Ethiopian Airlines Group revealed on Wednesday. Ethiopia's flag carrier in its report presented to the Ethiopian parliament on Wednesday indicated that the Chinese passengers represent one of the largest customer bases of the airlines. The Ethiopian airlines group, which is widely recognized as one of Africa's fastest growing airlines, has been frequently expressing its interest to attract Chinese passengers into the African continent and beyond. Esayas Woldemariam, Managing Director of Ethiopian airline's International Service, recently told Xinhua that the airlines has strong aspirations to grow its relations with its Chinese customers towards "being the most Chinese-friendly transit hub and airline in the African continent." Noting why the Ethiopian airline is preferred by majority of Chinese passengers, Woldemariam said that "we have a Chinese help desk here at the hub for passengers passing through here to Africa and coming back, we have Chinese dedicated staff here, we have Chinese crew on board, we have Chinese food, and we have Chinese call-center." The airline also celebrates Chinese festivals in a bid to attract its Chinese customers, which include a special event for Chinese nationals returning home for the Chinese New Year, or Spring Festival every February. Ethiopian Airlines is currently the biggest carrier of passenger and cargo between China and Africa, with 5 destinations in China that are Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Chengdu and Guangzhou. The company has also finalized its preparations to add Shenzhen on the list.
