The number of flood victims in Kilifi County might shoot to about 18,000 people, the Kenya Red Cross Society has said. This is after River Sabaki, which stretches from Athi River, broke bits banks following the ongoing rains. About 3,000 people in Kakuyuni, Garashi and Sabaki wards are already homeless and are in dire need of help. CHOPPERS Kilifi County Red Cross Coordinator Hakima Masoud, said that most of the affected areas were neither accessible by boat not by road. Speaking after touring some parts of Kakuyuni Ward, Ms Masoud said only choppers could be used to evacuate the flood victims. "We have supplied the displaced families with blankets and water treatment chemicals. We were working with Interior Ministry to ensure they get food supplies," she said. Already, some of the flood victims camp in schools. Some workers in Galana Conservancy, who were stranded for the better part of Wednesday, were rescued by Kenya Wildlife Service personnel and the Kenya Red Cross staff.
