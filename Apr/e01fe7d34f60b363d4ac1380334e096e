Kenyans are wondering why every part of the country is flooded except dams, which should ideally be full of reserve waters right now. The concerns come in the wake of the heavy rains across the country for two months now that have led to flooding. Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company last week shocked Nairobi MCAs by admitting that water rationing in the city will continue until it rains heavily in Ndakaini dam's catchment areas of Aberdares, Kikuyu and Mount Kenya. Nairobians had hoped the water levels at Ndakaini dam will increase with the current rains and end the perennial water shortages. Some online users have suggested that the construction of new dams be expedited to ensure all the rain water is harvested for use in the city. I still need someone to explain to me how almost every part of the country is flooded except dams ðŸ¤” - I can't believe I (@WarariJK) April 22, 2018 Ama dams zimetoboka? -- I can't believe I (@WarariJK) April 22, 2018 Source of water is not sufficient... aberdares... It all comes down to deafforestation! -- Edwin Ondieki (@NiMimiEdu) April 23, 2018 I live near the Aberdare forest. Its raining daily. Rivers are full. Kama mliambiwa huku hakuna maji, mlidanganywa. And, no, the deforestation is not as serious as the cartels would have you believe. -- Suleman Wanjiku (@sulemanwanjiku) April 24, 2018 1. Cartels... we have no other viable explanation of why we can't harvest the rain water... 2. We need to work on our catchment areas for more green water which is actually what is attracted by the trees and sips into the dams... -- raquel (@raquel_mbugua) April 23, 2018
