Things started to unravel at auditing giant KPMG SA after one of its clients, furniture giant Steinhoff, was exposed for some "creative accounting" that saw the sudden resignation of its CEO Markus Jooste. Christo Wiese, the company chairman, lost half of his fortune within days as the share price hit rock bottom. Authorities are questioning if, and how KPMG, missed glaring irregularities at the company. Now, two executives at the firm have resigned after their failure to disclose their association with VBS Mutual Bank.
