National Environmental Management Agency (Nema) on Monday closed down all slaughterhouses in Kiamaiko, Nairobi, for not complying with various regulations, especially the management of solid and liquid waste. Nema communications manager Evans Nyabuto said the slaughterhouses, popular for goat meat from northern Kenya, were closed for not having waste water pre-treatment facilities. "We have ordered the immediate closure of Kiamaiko slaughterhouses because they do not have pre-treatment facilities. It is required that such facilities install waste water pre-treatment and quality analysis facilities," said Mr Nyabuto. He said the slaughterhouses are a major source of pollutants to Nairobi River which is currently being rehabilitated by Nema, the Ministry of Environment and Nairobi County government. RIPARIAN LAND "Part of our work is to check which areas are polluting the river. We realised that all Kiamaiko slaughterhouses are discharging their waste directly to Nairobi River," he said. Mr Nyabuto said the order will be in force until the slaughterhouses comply with the set environmental regulations. "Our officers will there to ensure that no one slaughters any animal," said Mr Nyabuto. Nema director general Geoffrey Wahungu said the agency is conducting inspections in settlements and business premises near the river to find out if they have been contributing to the pollution. He said premises that do not comply with relevant environmental regulations on riparian reserves and waste management and disposal, among others, will be closed. He said areas under surveillance include Dagoretti, Kawangware, Karen (Nairobi Dam), Kirichwa Kubwa and Kirichwa Ndogo, Mater and Kiamaiko.
