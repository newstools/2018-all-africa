The National Arts Council (NAC), National Museums Board, Zambia Development Agency (ZDA) has partnered with Private Enterprise Programme Zambia (PEP) to develop a sustainable handicraft market that will lead to the production of high standard products for both local and export market. Ministry of Tourism and Arts Permanent Secretary Howard Sikwela said the partnership would help promote the sales of Zambian crafts both within the tourism sector and through links to export markets. Dr Sikwela said the ministry has identified notable skills within the handicraft sector and a significant opportunity for developing sales both within Zambia and beyond. "Government appreciates and supports PEP efforts to help develop and promote the local handicraft industry as it will contribute to the growth of the arts and culture sector in general. Local tourism products and attractions have largely been in the area of wildlife and natural resources which should now completely change by developing and promoting other features in the tourism sector such as the handicrafts industry, "he said. Dr Sikwela further appealed to handicraft producers to take advantage of the opportunity to produce quality products that can easily be marketed. PEPZ tourism and hospitality manager Namaya Lewanika said the project would deliver significant and long-term sales and yield a positive impact for thousands of artisans and crafts people in the country through enhanced sales and profitability. "We are delighted to announce that the project includes bringing in experienced designers from target markets to work alongside local artisans, to fine-tune their products to maximize their appeal to overseas customers while preserving local traditions. We are also inviting key wholesale buyers from the world market, the resulting trade will allow our local craftsmen and women to build successful businesses based on Zambia's traditional crafts like basket-making and wood.
