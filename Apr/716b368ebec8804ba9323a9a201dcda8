The U.S. Congress has passed a resolution expressing concern about human rights developments in Ethiopia. It calls for respect for human rights and encourages inclusive governance, but also condemns "the killing of peaceful protesters and excessive use of force by Ethiopian security forces; the detention of journalists, students, activists and political leaders who exercise their constitutional rights to freedom of assembly and expression through peaceful protests; and the abuse of the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation to stifle political and civil dissent and journalistic freedoms." According to the Ethiopian Herald this resolution "will not fracture the Ethio-US diplomatic ties", the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said.
