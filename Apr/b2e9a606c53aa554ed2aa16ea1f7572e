Johannesburg â€” SOUTH Africa's so-called Triple R model has been hailed as the reason the country boasts the highest number of Africa's domain name registrations, coupled with the lowest cost on the continent. The country of 55 million people is the leading domain name market on a continent of over 1 billion people. It has over 1,1 million domains registered under the .za internet country code. Adopted in 2010, the Triple R Mdel is based on the separation of functions and responsibilities by the Regulator the Registry Operator and the Registrar. Lucky Masilela, ZA Central Registry (ZACR) Chief Executive Officer, said the organisation, as the Central Registry responsible for the technical wellbeing of South Africa's presence on the worldwide web, the dozens of Registrars that interface with domain name Registrants and the ZA Domain Name Authority (ZADNA) as the government-appointed industry regulator, had jointly created a local Domain Name System (DNS) industry that was "the envy of much of the world." "The Triple-R model is, simply put, division and specialisation of functions in the domain name industry," Masilela said. He said the focus on automation and on every player concentrating on what they do best had seen the emergence of a South African DNS industry where resilience, reliability and affordability reign supreme. "The consumer is the winner," added Masilela. The executive argued "rushed" discussions around the current domain name industry model were threatening the highly-effective central registry model endorsed by the late Communications Minister, Dr Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri. ZACR is responsible for the technical and administrative wellbeing of the entire South African presence on the web and is on its way to achieving a quarter century of pioneering achievements within the sector.
