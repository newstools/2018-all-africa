Hotel owners in Tana River have raised concern over dirty water coming from the taps. They said this is costing them as customers are questioning the hygiene of the food. Ahmed Bushra, a hotel owner, said he has lost many customers who are doubting food hygiene. "The customers leave immediately they see the water," he said. He said they have to wait for the water to settle before they can use it. The hoteliers and residents are now accusing Tana River Water Services Company (Tawasco) of negligence. ALWAYS TREATED "We cannot beg for services we have a right to. Tawasco should know we pay for the services it provides. We need value for our money," said Amina Kodobo, a resident. County water services director Gwiyo Madubi said the problem is as a result of water being pumped directly from the river. "Turbidity is a big problem in our county because our river is dirty. However, the water pumped to tanks is always treated and can cause no harm," he said. He urged residents to be patient as the department together with the Tawasco board and the county government works to ensure the situation rectified.
