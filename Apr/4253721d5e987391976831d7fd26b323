The Agricultural Bank of Zimbabwe (Agribank) has lent $7 million of a $10 million facility to support horticulture farmers, an official has said. The facility was launched in June last year to support farmers across the country with working capital as well acquisition of assets. It is expected to boost the foreign currency earnings by the sub-sector, with the export of horticulture and floriculture products to the European Union markets.
