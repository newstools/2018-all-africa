Big Brother Naija 2018 housemates could not hide their disappointment, when Cee-C returned to the house following the eviction of Khloe, Anto and Lolu on Sunday. Cee-c was last week put up for possible eviction alongisde Lolu, Miracle, Anto and Khloe, but she narrowly escaped the 'big hammer' last night during the live show after securing 27.888% vote behind Miracle, who topped with 44.33%. However, none of the housmates rushed to hug Cee-c, neither were there any scream of excitement when she returned to the house. Only Miracle brought out a bottle of champagne to pop in celebration, asking Cee-C to give a speech on what she is grateful for. She nonchalantly replied thus, "I am grateful that I'm here despite all the adversity, challenges and gossips". Cee-C makes the finals of this year's BIG Brother Naija reality show,along side with Alex, Miracle and Nina
