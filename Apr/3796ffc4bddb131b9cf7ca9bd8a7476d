Mogadishu â€” AT least five people, including two children, have died following severe flooding that has displaced thousands of refugees in Somalia. The presence of the terror group, Al-Shabaab has hindered delivery of aid to affected communities across the conflict-prone East African country. The children have been confirmed dead in Cadaado city in the central Galgudud region as rains worsen conditions in overcrowded Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) settlements. An estimated 9 300 displaced people in the settlements have been affected and an unknown number has moved to nearby towns until flooding recedes. In Jubaland, three people have died as a result of flash floods in Ceel Waaq and Ceel Cadde in the southern Jubaland. An estimated 28 200 people have been displaced. Up to 350 000 people are at risk. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) bemoaned the presence of terror groups in the area. "Due to the presence of Al-Shabaab, humanitarian partners have little access to such areas in Middle Juba region," a spokesperson said. Ironically, the Al-Shabaab has displaced the citizens from their homes through a reign of terror over two decades. In contrast to 2017 when the country suffered drought, heavy rains have pummeled Somalia since the beginning of March. Subsequent flooding has increased the risk of diseases such as malaria, acute watery diarrhea and cholera.
