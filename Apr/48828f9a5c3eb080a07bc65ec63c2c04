The Next Einstein Forum is setting up a U.S.$1 million fund to encourage scientific breakthroughs in Africa. This comes after Cameroonian medical doctor Conrad Tankou won the organisation's top health award for his invention of a portable digital microscope that connects to a smartphone to remotely scan for cervical cancers. This, along with blood made poisonous to mosquitos and an application to detect diseases and pests in crops, are among some of the most recent groundbreaking innovations coming from the continent.
