The Only Jealousy of Emer, written by well-known Irish writer, William Butler Yeats, and directed by Ray Yeates, will star Ireland-based Nigerian actors, Yemi Adenuga, Deji Adenuga, Oluwayomi Ogunyemi, Esosa Ighodaro and Penelope Anyaji-Aniuzu. It is the presentation of Nigerian Carnival Ireland, and scheduled for this Saturday, April 14, 2018 at Freedom Park, Lagos. The play centres around mythic Irish hero Cuchulainn, who has killed his son and in grief attempts to fight the sea. Half drowned, he lies in a state between life and death, with his wife and mistress watching over him. Strange events occur, as Cuchulainn has in fact been replaced by a changeling and they try tirelessly to get him back, bringing onto the stage demons, ghosts and the supernatural. The play encapsulates a great sense of multiculturalism with the contribution of Nigerian Carnival Ireland. It puts an interesting spin on the play as it is combining both Nigerian and Irish cultures to create a unique masterpiece, that those with a high regard and interest in culture and theatre would thoroughly enjoy.
