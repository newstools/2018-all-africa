After giving his much-anticipated speech at Chatham House, a venue that is associated with the core values of democracy and freedom, President Uhuru Kenyatta came out to rowdy, placard-wielding protesters chanting "respect human rights" and "respect rule of law". He is accused of human rights abuses, ignoring the rule of law and mismanaging the Kenyan economy. Kenyatta is attending Commonwealth Heads of Govt Meeting that brings together leaders from the 53 countries that make up the Commonwealth of Nations.
