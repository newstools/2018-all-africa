Poised to tackle the menace of plastic bottles in the state, the Lagos State government is to establish plastic collection centres in 57 council areas of the state. Special Adviser to the Governor on the Cleaner Lagos Initiative, Adebola Shabi, who disclosed this at the weekend, said when established, youths will be encouraged to bring plastic to the centres and given something in return, while the plastics will be sold to the public for reuse. This, he said, was in tune with the theme of the World Earth Day this year that centred on plastic pollution, one of the biggest menace in the state today. He assured Lagosians that with the renewed collaboration between the state government, waste collection operators and Visionscape, heaps of refuse would disappear from Lagos streets in few days. According to him, concerted efforts of the stakeholders will lead to an imminent total evacuation of waste from the streets. He said: "We have been engaging different stakeholders, the waste collection operators, the community development committees, the market women, the civil societies, landlords and tenants' associations and various NGOs in the state to assess how we have performed in the last one year. "There are still ongoing discussions with the waste collection operators, the former PSP operators and the state government, in conjunction with Visionscape to have as many Transfer Loading Stations, to ease the disposal of waste in the state."
