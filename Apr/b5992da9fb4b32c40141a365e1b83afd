Opposition Radical Revolutionary Party president Vincent Chaile says the decision to ban public service transport from operating at night is yielding nothing. Chaile says the decision was left an economic dent and if left unchanged will continue to hinder progress. BELOW IS CHAILE'S STATEMENT The ban of long distance public service buses from moving at night has not yield a positive results. It has caused more harm than good. It has also slowed down the economy because businesses people are made to sleep on the way hence causing unnecessary delays Despite the night ban we have witnessed 3 fatal accidents within a month from one company Juldan motors.This clearly shows that there is no relationship between night travel and accidents. Night ban has actually caused alot bus drivers to over speed in a bid to beat on time. In short drivers drive out of panic. We therefore appearing to govt lift the ban and put a speed limit to below 90 km/h for all pubic public service buses. Vincent Chaile President for Radical Revolutionary Party
