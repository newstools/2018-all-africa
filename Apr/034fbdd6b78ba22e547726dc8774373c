Ex-housemates Bambam and Teddy A were treated to a one of a kind homecoming party on Saturday 7th of March 2018 at the Rumours nightclub in Ikeja. Courtesy of the only full brewed stout in this part of the world - Legend Extra Stout, the night was all shades of amazing as the housemate stepped into their party looking all glamourous. The lovebirds came well prepared to slay with Bambam wearing a black full fringed dress paired with pink heels and Teddy A looking all dapper in black jeans paired with an orange blazer. When we say there ain't no party like a Legend extra stout party, we mean every word of it. The ex housemates sure had a time of their lives, from the DJ, to the interviews and photo sessions with fans, they seem to have garnered even more fans post eviction period. The show of love for this two is undeniably massive and it is safe to say they know how to enjoy a great party. One of the highlight of the night was when Nigeria's music industry fave couple, 2Baba and Annie Idibia made a stop at the club to party with the ex housemates. They were extremely excited to meet the power couple and could not contain their excitement. Other ex-housemates like Vandora, DeeOne and Bitto were also in attendance to party with them.
