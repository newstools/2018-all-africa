Afro jazz fusion artiste Pardon Saliem Namame, popularly known as "Matirikoti", is basking in glory as his new single album has been received well by fans. The Ex-Tripple Pace lead vocalist who recently put up a brilliant performance at La-Rouge in Westgate said music ran in his blood. Some of the songs performed at the show include "Shanda", "Usandirwadziwe", "Matsimba", "Haarare" and "Kumakomoyo". So good was his performance that the fans demanded more and he had to be called back on stage to satisfy their appetite. In an interview, Matirikoti said he was happy with the turnout. "Everything went according to plan and I was surprised by the huge turnout at the event. My singles' collection is fused with love, motivational, culture and societal issues. I wish to succeed in my musical career. I am now working on launching my album early May. I wanted to do that in April but the challenge is that the month is packed with events that include the Davido concert and also the Thomas Mpafumo show," he said. The dread-locked star, who usually performs barefoot, said his biggest wish is to perform at the much awaited Thomas Mapfumo show scheduled to take place on April 28. "My management is still trying to link up with the organisers of the famous show. If we strike a deal, it will be a dream come true to perform and share the stage with an icon. I have learnt a lot from Mukanya's music and it is my desire to get two minutes of fame with him. If given the opportunity, I would want to share my new song with him," he said. However, Matirikoti's solo career has since paid off as he is now finishing his debut DVD album. "What local music fans have been waiting for is here. I am now on production stage of my DVD album. One thing I like about videography is that I direct and write the concept for my videos. This has helped me to keep that natural feel," he said.
