The nurses strike may have contributed to the death of Miriro Tsvangirai, sister to the late opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. According to reports, she died of asthma and heart disease complications after she had been discharged from Parirenyatwa Hospital as nurses had downed tools. The thousands of nurses who were sacked after they went on strike for better wages have since been told to return to work by their union.
