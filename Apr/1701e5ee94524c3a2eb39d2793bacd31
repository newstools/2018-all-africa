The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) views the signing of the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) today by the communist turned capitalist Minister Jeff Radebe as an insult to the working class and the poor. We are highly angered that the ANC led government has signed the outstanding 27 IPPs contracts. The clean energy project is hijacked by the capitalist for their narrow capitalist interests. The ANC led government is privatizing Eskom through the back door to satisfy their Davos handlers and white monopoly capital. The NUM is not going to continue supporting the ANC led government that is destroying jobs. Workers of this country will not continue to vote and support an organization which is taking away jobs from the poor. We cannot perpetually campaign and vote for the so-called NEW DAWN as narrated by Cyril Ramaphosa. Over 40 000 jobs will be lost in mining, energy and the entire value chain, rendering Witbank and the surrounding areas into ghost towns. The NUM demand that President Cyril Ramaphosa must stop this nonsensical IPPs and must reverse the decision. We are tired of supporting the organization which is indicating left but turning right.
