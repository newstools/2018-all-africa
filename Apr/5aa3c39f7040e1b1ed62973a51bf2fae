South Africa's world-renowned isicathamiya group Ladysmith Black Mambazo (pictured) must be feeling the globe in their hands because of their deserved fifth Grammy music award for Best World Music album for Shaka Zulu Revisited: 30th Anniversary Collection last month. Yesterday, they had a street parade and celebration in Durban to mark their famous win. Ladysmith Black Mambazo is a group with an enduring commitment to vocal excellence and nifty choreography over a five decade spread. Founded by Joseph Shabalala in the aftermath of a dream of a choir in which children sang and danced, Shabalala turned his dream into reality forming the world beating group. Many years down the line, the group has been a most notable exponent of South African music garnering plaudits and collaboartions with some of the most illustrious musiciansthe world has ever known from the Stevie Wonder, Dolly Parton, and Paul Simon to the late king of pop Michael Jackson. Film and television appearences have been part of the group's fantastic journey. The group has just returned from a triumphant three month United States tour and yesterday's celebrations saw them wade through the Durban streets in a rickshaw to e delight of throngs of adoring local fans. They are poised to perform before the Queen of England on her birthday later in the month followed by a European tour.
