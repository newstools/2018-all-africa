Windhoek â€” The Indian High Commission in Namibia and the City of Windhoek last week hosted the 'India's Day with Windhoek', aimed at promoting awareness and cooperation at local government level between India and the City of Windhoek. Windhoek mayor Muesee Kazapua said during the formal proceedings that the event is a stepping stone for municipal partnership and "people to people relationship". The event, which will henceforth be observed annually, will further cement the cordial relations that exist between India and Namibia, Kazapua believes. "Promoting arts and culture is at the top of our agenda and it is, therefore, no coincidence that we agreed without hesitation to partner with the High Commission of India in organising this important event," added Kazapua. Furthermore, he highlighted that the City of Windhoek and the Indian High Commission are working towards formalising cooperation at local government level and through that the aim is to strengthen the "already existing good relationship between Namibia and India", stressed Kazapua. The Indian High Commissioner to Namibia, Kumar Tuhin, said the aim of organising the event was to increase awareness and promote understanding between the governments and the people at state-city levels. There is an increasing trend of devolution of power and decentralisation of decision-making all over the world, Tuhin noted. In India, the state governments are playing increasingly crucial roles in interacting with foreign governments to attract investment and tourism, added Tuhin. He also said the State of Bihar was chosen for this event as this state contains some of the most ancient tourist sites in India, including Bodh Gaya where Lord Buddha attained enlightenment. Tuhin was further hopeful that the event would provide a glimpse of culture, craft and cuisine from the State of Bihar, which would lead to better understanding and cooperation at local level between the two sides.
