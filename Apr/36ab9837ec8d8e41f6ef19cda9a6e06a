Britain's Prince Harry hosted Malawian President Prof. Arthur Peter Mutharika at Buckingham Palace in London when they has a private audience on Tuesday. According to Presidential Press Secretary Mgeme Kalilani, the Prince and the Malawi leader discussed how to further promote wildlife conservation as one way of enriching benefits that Malawi gets from its tourism industry.

Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Emmanuel Fabiano said the President's meeting with the Prince was "fruitful." Meanwhile, Mutharika has hailed the long standing partnership which Malawi enjoys with the All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) in the United Kingdom Parliament.
