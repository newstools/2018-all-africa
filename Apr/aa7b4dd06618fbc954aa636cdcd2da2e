The Department of Agriculture has developed a series of new and innovative ways to communicate with the public about the drought and climate change. The first of these is the department's Drought Portal, a designated site where up to date information regarding the drought can be easily accessed. Farmers will also be able get up to date dam levels, complete a disaster survey and access a handy "drought toolkit". This can be accessed by visiting www.elsenburg.com/drought The department has also launched Gooi Agri,which allows users to upload short videos of their own smart-agriculture practices and techniques. Each month will be themed and the first theme is "drought and water". While each theme will run for one month, the first theme will run until the end of May, because of the importance of water and the impact of the drought. All videos can be uploaded online at http://www.elsenburg.com/gooiagri/ or video clips can be sent via whatsapp to 062 044 9061. The best video clips will be featured on the website and shared via various media platforms. In addition, the department is producing a weekly radio programme called Die Kwik Styg on RSG. The show, launched earlier this month, is presented by seasoned broadcaster Lizma Van Zyl. The weekly programme focuses on climate change and includes internationally renowned experts as guest speakers. It is broadcast on Fridays at 12.45. Previous episodes are available on the RSG website for download. Minister of Economic Opportunities, Alan Winde said "the drought and climate change impact us all, and the agricultural sector have been hit hard. However, these recent initiatives show that the department is looking at innovative ways to keep farmers and farming communities informed with up to date and accurate information that will help them make the best possible decisions going forward."
