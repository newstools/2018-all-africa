Forensic Data Analysis, a company owned by former policeman turned businessman Keith Keating, a supplier to the police who is alleged to have bribed former acting police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane, has threatened to bring the criminal justice system to a halt if he didn't get paid. Keating apparently made good on his threat, partially shutting down some services.
