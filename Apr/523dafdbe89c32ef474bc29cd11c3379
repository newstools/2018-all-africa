"If you catch your man cheating halafu alie aseme ni shetani ati umuombee, can you forgive him?" This elicited mixed reactions from other online users who joined the conversation explaining what they would do in the situation. "No. I will make him marry Shetani," said one online user. "Nitasamehea shetani bt yy.mhhh mama Brianna style," wrote another online user. "Nitamuombea but nitacheat na itakua ile day nilikuombea zilivuka kwangu so niombee pia," said one online user. "You slap the devil outta him then leave," responded another online user. "Aende kuoa shetani ju ni kama wanapendana sana hadi they visit each other," said another online user.
