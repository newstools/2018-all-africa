Stakeholders will next month meet to exchange ideas with the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, NOSDRA, on the sensitization of oil spill incidents, response and management in oil producing areas in the Niger Delta. NOSDRA will use the summit to step up public awareness on its roles/footprints and to create enlightenment on the techniques to be applied by operators in the industry if and when the incidents occur. According to the organiser of the summit, "The preventive measures and remediation efforts will be highlighted in technical papers to be presented by experts at the two-day summit. "Participants will have the opportunity to highlight their contributions to NOSDRA's posture of zero tolerance for oil spills in oil producing communities and also to underscore the observance of requisite environmental best practices by operators in the industry. "The summit is coming at a time when the adoption of global best practices is being demanded of all companies who are engaged in exploration and production (E & P) activities in the Niger Delta."
