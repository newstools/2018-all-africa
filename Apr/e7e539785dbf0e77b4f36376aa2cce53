The government, with the support of the World Wide Fund for Nature, will embark on a 12-month project which aims to save the remaining elephants in the Selous Game Reserve from poaching. 60 elephants are expected to be collared which will enable reserve management and government rangers to track elephant movements and identify and act against threats.
