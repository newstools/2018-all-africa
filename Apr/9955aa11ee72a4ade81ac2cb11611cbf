The award-winning singer issued an apology saying: "I've had a long conversation with the authorities and I have learnt that what I did was not right. As a role model to many young people, not just in Tanzania but across the continent, posting a private moment was irresponsible of me". Diamond was arrested for posting a video clip of himself playfully kissing a woman.
