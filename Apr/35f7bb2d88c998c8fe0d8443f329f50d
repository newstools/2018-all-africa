PREMIUM TIMES reported how Zainab and her four-year-old daughter, Petral, were found dead on April 5 at their Banana Island resident, Ikoyi, where she resided with her husband, Peter Nielsen. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Edgal Imohimi, said the forensic report revealed that there were blood stains from the couples' bedroom to the kitchen. "Even though it was cleverly wiped from the floor, experts were still able to detect it with the application of special chemical reagents. "Blood stains were also discovered on the wash-hand basins and on the hand towel the suspect used in wiping his hands after the commission of the offence. "Although it was cleverly cleaned up as well, the experts were able to discover that too," Mr Imohimi said. He also said that forensic examinations were being carried out and would be used as evidence against the suspect, Peter Nielsen, who had been charged to court. Mr. Nielsen is already being prosecuted for the crime.
