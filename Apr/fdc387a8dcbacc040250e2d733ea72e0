Abuja â€” THE House of Representatives has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently deploy soldiers to Isu beachline boundary community in Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State to quell the incessant communal clashes between the community and another one in Cross River State. The House also mandated the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, to immediately and without further delay deploy relief materials (including medical supplies) to the communities in addition to medical and health personnel to treat those who sustained various degrees of injuries during the fracas. The House further mandated the National Boundary Commission to immediately demarcate and define the boundaries of both communities to avoid further clashes. The resolution followed the consideration and adoption of a motion under "Matters of Urgent National Importance" raised by Hon. Uko Nkole Ndukwe (PDP-Abia). The lawmaker while moving the motion decried the death of several innocent citizens of the community in Abia. According to him, the dispute had led to the razing of three villages. Ndukwe said: "Apart from the wanton loss of lives and property and massive displacement of persons, there is the resultant distrust among communities that is a grave threat to national unity and loss of confidence in social institutions. "The House is saddened that between Thursday, April 19, 2018 and Saturday, April 21, 2018, communual clashes erupted in Isu beachline boundary community in Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State which shares its boundary with Utuma in Cross River State."
