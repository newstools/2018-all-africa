Dodoma â€” Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation on Friday April 13 called on Tanzanian fishermen carrying out their fishing activities in the Indian Ocean along the coastlines of Kenya, to abide by the laws of the East African country. The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Dr Suzan Kolimba told parliament that Tanzania is now in talks with Kenyan authorities on how to harmonise security protocols along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean-in areas shared by Tanzania and Kenya. This follows a question raised by the Member of Parliament for Micheweni Constituency (CUF), Haji Khatib Kai who sought to know what the government was doing to engage the Tanzanian Embassy in Nairobi in the effort to settle the security and immigration challenges faced by Tanzanian fishermen in the Indian Ocean. "There has been some confusion among fishermen from Tanzania because of security protocols that Kenya was observing along its coastlines. But we are making efforts to settle these challenges" responded Dr Kolimba. "Meanwhile, I would like to ask all the fishermen from Tanzania to abide by the laws of Kenya as matters are being settled."
