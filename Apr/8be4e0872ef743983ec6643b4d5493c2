The Joint Health Sector Unions has announced an indefinite strike that will paralyse activities in all health institutions across the country. The union embarked on a nationwide strike last September to protest salary adjustments, promotion arrears, and improved work environment for its members. According to the union, six months after the resulting deal was struck, the government is yet to meet any of its demands.
