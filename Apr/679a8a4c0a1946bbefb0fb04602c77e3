Members of Parliament have called on the national government to declare cancer a national disaster and establish a special fund to facilitate treatment of patients. On Wednesday, the lawmakers, while contributing to a motion sponsored by Laikipia Woman Representative Catherine Waruguru, observed that treating cancer is very expensive and out of reach for most Kenyans. While moving the motion, Ms Waruguru regretted that many people have died of cancer, adding that the government should urgently declare the disease a national disaster so as to save the lives of others. "We care for the cancer patients and that is why I have taken this step to alleviate their suffering. [Declaring] the disease a national disaster will create more awareness and attract more donors to help us fight it," Ms Waruguru said. "Poor Kenyans are suffering due to lack of funds to seek medical treatment in public hospitals such as Kenyatta National Hospital and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital [which] lack adequate facilities to detect the disease," she added. COSTThe MPs pointed out that the few hospitals in the country such as the Nairobi Hospital, Aga Khan University Hospital and MP Shah Hospital that have better facilities for cancer treatment, are expensive and therefore a preserve of the rich. Nyatike MP Tom Odege accused the government of laxity in dealing with cancer, leading to increased fatalities. "Why is it easier to treat cancer patients in India than in Kenya. When you transfer a patient to India you pay even for the air ticket and food, and still this is very low as compared to seeking treatment locally. "When you go to a government hospital like Kenyatta National Hospital, you are likely to die while still waiting for the doctor," Mr Odege said. The MPs said that setting up a special fund for cancer will reduce the cost of treating the disease.
