Vice-Chancellor Ahmed Osman Warfa says Garissa University did not hold any event to commemorate the third anniversary of the attack as it will only bring back bad memories. On April 2, 2015, masked attackers stormed the institution early in the morning and shot over 140 students and six security officers dead.
