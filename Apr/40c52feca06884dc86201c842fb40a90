The Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, left Accra, yesterday, for a five-day working visit to the high-tech city of Silicon Valley, California, United States of America.

During the visit, the Vice President will hold discussions with Silicon Valley's thought and technology leaders to explore the possibilities of developing strategic insight, decisions and partnerships with the view to helping to enhance the digitisation of the Ghanaian economy to move Ghana beyond aid. It would be recalled that the Vice President recently visited a number of Ghanaian ICT firms to understand their challenges in order to aid policy formulation. The visit to Silicon Valley is, therefore, to engage world leaders in ICT in order to exchange ideas and fashion out Ghanaian solutions to Ghanaian challenges. Vice President Bawumia is also scheduled to meet with Corporate Executives of cutting edge digital technology organisations, including Microsoft, Facebook, Tesla, and Alphabet, and visit a number of facilities, including the G.E.
