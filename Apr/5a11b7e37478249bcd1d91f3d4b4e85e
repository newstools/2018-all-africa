The Tobacco Research Board (TRB) says tobacco yields could be cut by at least 30 percent this year due to an outbreak of the potato virus Y (PVY) across the country. Dahlia Garwe, the general manager of TRB, said the virus had become a huge challenge to tobacco farming. The PVY is caused by growing of crops in the same family, such as potatoes, tomatoes and pepper, in the same field or nearby farms.
