A Lagos Magistrate's Court sitting in Yaba, yesterday, remanded Danish national, Peter Nielsen, 53, who allegedly killed his wife Zainab, and his three-year-old daughter, Petra, in Ikoyi Prisons. Nielsen appeared before the court on a two-count charge bordering on murder. The offences are contrary to and punishable under Section 223 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015. The charge was read to him, but his plea was not taken. Count one of the charge read: "That you Peter Nielsen, on April, 5 at Block 4 Flat 17 Bella Vista Tower, Banana Island, Ikoyi, Lagos, in the Lagos Magisterial District did unlawfully killed your wife, Zainab Nielsen, aged 37, and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 223 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015." And count two read: "That you Peter Nielsen ( on same date and same place) unlawfully killed your daughter, Petra, aged three and half years and, thereby, committed an offence punishable under Section 223 of same laws." After the charge was read to the Danish, the prosecutor, Chief Superintendent Effiong Asuquo, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on April 5 at his residence. Asuquo said: "The defendant, who was always at loggerheads with his wife, had hit her head on the wall several times, leading to her death; he also proceeded to poison his daughter." Asuquo, however, urged the court to remand the defendant in prisons custody, pending legal advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP. In her ruling, Chief Magistrate Kikelomo Ayeye ordered the defendant remanded at the Ikoyi Prisons and adjourned till May 8 for outcome of DPP advice.
