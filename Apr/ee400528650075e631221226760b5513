If a person is food secure it typically means that sufficient quality food is available, they have enough resources to buy food for a nutritious diet and they have stable access to adequate food at all times.

These include civil conflicts, large-scale displacement, rising food prices, climate change, natural resource degradation, poverty and population growth, writes Titilayo Adebola for The Conversation Africa.
