Kampala â€” The couple longed for a child after three years in marriage. When 33-year-old Rosette Ofubo, a police officer in the Engineering and Logistics directorate, finally conceived, trepidation momentarily replaced joy. She was not just pregnant. A born-again Christian had quadruplets, doctors said. Ms Ofubo had been battling fibroids, a non-cancerous tumour growth in the uterus, and therefore worried about the possibility of a miscarriage. This fear confounded her not to share the otherwise good news widely with relatives and friends. In any case, the pair had been hard at prayers to beget a child and broadcasting the information prematurely when uncertain the pregnancy would progress normally prompted them to hush up. "I was very excited but worried as well," she said. After the first trimester, gynaecologist Joseph Nsenga discovered that Ms Ofubo's uterus was weak to hold all the babies. This worsened her nightmares and that of the husband Joseph Ofubo. Obstetricians decided to carry out a cervical cerclage, a medical procedure to stitch the cervix to firm up the uterus, to prevent premature birth and or miscarriage. And it worked. Ms Ofubo checked into at Bethany Women's and Family Hospital in Luzira last Sunday and the doctors helped her deliver the quadruplets, two girls and a pair of boys. It was a moment of joy, Dr Nsenga said, as the "dad was there to name and tag the babies as they kept coming out one after another". The hospital last registered the birth of a quadruplet in 2015, and its staff were elated as well. Mr Ofubo, who works as a mechanic and photographer, said whereas there are concerns about expenses associated with raising four children at a go, the God that brought them together while at the Christ's Disciples Church in Misindye Seeta, Mukono District, will provide.
