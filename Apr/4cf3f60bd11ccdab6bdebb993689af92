A remorseful Koffi made the revelation about his upcoming gig in a video shared on social media. "My brothers and sisters in Kenya I'll be in Kakamega for the Devolution Conference on the 24th of April at the Bukhungu Stadium. Be with me I miss you so much," he said. "I love you so much. Thanks to governor Oparanya for inviting (me). Thank you for everything... for giving me opportunity to be back."

KICKED OUT The flamboyant musician was kicked out of Kenya on July 23, 2016 after kicking his dancer at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi. His band had just arrived at JKIA for a much-anticipated concert with hordes of his fans, who had already bought tickets, ready for a Selfie-Ekoti te hit song treat. He spent a night in JKIA police cells and was later deported to Kinshasa, where he was arrested and charged with the crime. The singer apologized to Kenyans for his behaviour. Koffi was jailed for 18 months without the option of a fine. However, after spending five days in Kinshasa's Makala Prison, the entertainer was released on a bail.
