We will do our best to safeguard our arms and other vital weapons. "Arms verification is not simple as people think it is, however, we will pay special attention to it especially at this period where there's proliferation of arms and light weapons not just in our country but also across our borders. '"This this verification will assist us to identify if there's any gaps or loopholes so that we can address the issues immediately. "We will do our best to preserve our arms and other vital weapons so that they don't get into wrong hands," he said.

Theophilus Danjuma (rtd), that the military is conniving with killer herdsmen to perpetuate heinous crimes against Taraba State indigenes. Danjuma also charged the state indigenes to defend themselves against killer herdsmen or perish. It was based on the above allegations that the committees were set up on March 19 and April 9 respectively by the army chief.
