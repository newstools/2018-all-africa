Blantyre â€” AMREF Health Africa in Malawi Health System Advocacy Partnership (HSAP) Programme Manager, Bernadette Chinsakaso has said the project would strengthen human resources for health and increase people's access to sexual and reproductive health services.

"The partnership focuses on strengthening human resources for health and improve people's access to sexual and reproductive health commodities while advocating for good governance equitable health financing," she said, adding that the project would allow communities in Sub-Saharan Africa to enjoy their health rights. "The HSAP has been set up to contribute to stronger health system so that people in Africa can realise their rights to the highest attainable sexual and reproductive health services," the Manager added.
