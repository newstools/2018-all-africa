The popular rapper Cassper Nyovest's message on black people reclaiming land has impressed many South Africans - in particular, the Economic Freedom Fighters for its portrayal of land reform. EFF leader Julius Malema tweeted: "Thank you very much my brother @CassperNyovest for the powerful music video, the message is very clear that indeed when we get our land #ksazobalit. #WeAreReady #LandIsDignity".
