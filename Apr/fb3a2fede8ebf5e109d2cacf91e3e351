Outgoing American ambassador to Kenya, Robert Godec, was on Thursday morning hosted by Radio Jambo in a farewell show to the Kenyan audience. Godec, whose five and a half â€“ year tenure in Kenya ended late last month, responded to diverse questions from listeners touching on various issues regarding his tenure in Kenya. An earlier version of this story contained factual errors which are highly regretted. It has therefore been pulled down.
