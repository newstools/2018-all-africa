Johannesburg â€” HUAWEI has confirmed its success in the South African market after launching the much-anticipated P20 smartphone series. The phones' debut in South African coincides with the recent release of Huawei's Quarter 4 2017 global results, which showed that local brand consideration of Huawei devices locally had almost doubled in the past year, from 13 percent to 25 percent. "Huawei's 2017 results highlight our extremely positive growth, both here and in other markets," noted Likun Zhao, Vice-President of Huawei Consumer Business Group in Southern Africa. He said global shipments of Huawei smartphones reached 153 million devices last year - an increase of 41,6 percent since 2015 while our global revenue for the Huawei Consumer Business Group increased by 39 percent in just one year to $36 billion. In South Africa, Huawei's growing reputation ensured a 66 percent increase in sales of the Mate 10 Pro compared to the Huawei Mate 9. Similarly, sales grew by 67 percent comparing the Huawei P9 to Huawei P10. "Having firmly cemented ourselves as SA's third largest smartphone manufacturer, the Huawei P20 series is set to do even better in this country," Zhao said. The Huawei P20 series includes unprecedented AI advances for a groundbreaking smartphone experience. The 5.8-inch screen Huawei P20 and 6.1-inch screen Huawei P20 Pro feature ultra-thin bezels and impressive screen-to-body ratios. The camera configuration is comprised of a 40MP RGB sensor, a 20MP monochrome sensor, and an 8MP sensor with telephoto lens.
