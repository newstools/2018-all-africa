Musician Otile Brown and socialite Vera Sidika have left tongues wagging over the nature of their relationship after taping themselves looking all cuddly. Otile Brown recently sent rumourville on an overdrive after his pictures with singer Sanaipei Tande in a wedding scene surfaced on social media. It later emerged the photos were taken a shoot of the video of their recent collabo "Chaguo la Moyo." But on Tuesday, Otile Brown posted a video on Insta story of himself with Vera as he rested his head on the socialite bosom. Otile Brown then provocatively rubs his head on Vera's breasts. In a separate Insta story post by Vera shortly afterwards, the two are in a bedroom setting and Otile has one hand resting across Vera's chest. He then kisses Vera's neck as she girlishly giggles and calls him babe.
