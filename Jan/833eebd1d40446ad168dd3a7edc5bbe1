The Dora Milaje are superior women recruited from every tribe of the fictional Wakanda who serve as the personal bodyguards of the Black Panther. She might feature alongside Hollywood hot shots, Don Cheadle, Chris Pratt, Scarlett Johansson and others. . PREMIUM TIMES reached out to the 41-year-old actress for a confirmation of the report. She was yet to provide a response at the time of filing this report. An earlier release, "Avengers 2: Age of Ultron", saw the filmmakers feature a place named Lagos in a fighting scene where some Marvel superheroes engaged themselves in battle.
