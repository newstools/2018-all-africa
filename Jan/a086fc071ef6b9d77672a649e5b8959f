The Edo State Government in partnership with Viko Nigeria has unveiled tourism information desks at the Benin Airport, Benin City, to market the state's tourism sites. Speaking at the unveiling of the desks at the arrival and departure wings of the Benin Airport on Wednesday, Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, said he wants investors and visitors to know about the tourism potentials of the state. The governor, represented by his Chief of Staff, Chief Taiwo Akerele, said the idea driving the project is the commitment to make the state a 24-hour economy. "As a state, we want to leverage on our potentials to attract local and foreign investments. We are partnering with the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) to make night landing possible at the airport to increase influx of passengers coming into the state for business and leisure." Commissioner for Arts, Culture and Diaspora Affairs, Hon. Osaze Osemwegie-Ero, said the information desks are a part of the arts and tourism roadmap for the development of the state. He said the idea was conceived by Governor Obaseki in his quest to boost investments and employment opportunities in the state. "The airport is the gateway to the state if you are coming by air and the desk will give all the needed information about the places to visit in the state," he said. Executive Director, Viko Nigeria, Mr Kanu Chidi, said tourism portends great potential in developing the economy, noting that the partnership will yield positive results for Edo people. He added that the information to be provided to guests visiting the state include information about culture, tourism, hotel reservation, taxes and other information about the state.
