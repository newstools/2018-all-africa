Blantyre â€” Former No Sleep Gang member, Lilongwe based Zane (spelt as Zvne) has released a new hit "Unstable" following the release of his debut single "Love you". Zvne confirmed this in an interview on Monday, saying he was inspired by Pompi, a Zambian artist whose songs encourage people who seem down or lost their way, trying to remind them that there is a God who takes care of our every need. "Unstable is a song that talks about a girl who is unstable, highlighting a bit on how some youths live their lifestyles in these modern days. The song sounds mellow and has an Afro vibe but the main message is centered on how the right focus should be on God," said Zvne. The up and coming gospel artist has revealed that he is currently working on a debut album adding that, he sees his music going the right direction. He said: "If my music doesn't save or inspire someone's life then what am I doing it for". The young talented artist has two songs to his credit "Love you" and "Unstable". Zvne was featured in No Sleep Gang's "Chandelier" which gained popularity amongst his peers and he left to focus on his solo career. "Unstable" was produced by Lilongwe based Manifest.
