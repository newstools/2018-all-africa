The High Court has temporarily suspended the ban on night travel. Justice Enoch Chacha Mwita on Thursday barred the National Transport & Safety Authority (NTSA) and the National Police Service from effecting the night travel ban. "Pending the hearing and determination of this case, the court is pleased to suspend NTSA and the Police Service's undated as well as unsigned joint press statement which suspended night travel for all long distance Public Service Vehicles from December 31, 2017," the judge said. The judge issued the order in the case filed by activist Okiya Omtatah ,who has sued NTSA, the National Police Service and the Attorney-General. Mr Omtatah argued that the ban had "gravely" affected travellers who use public means and the businesses that depend on it. He faulted NTSA and the police for issuing the night travel ban in a statement which he describes as a kneejerk reaction to the menace of road accidents on Kenyan roads. He also faulted the government for failing to take any measures to cushion PSV operators and other affected businesses from losses incurred as a result of the ban.
