FIVE players have been selected to form the national golf team that will represent the country in All Africa Junior Golf Championship. The annual championship is scheduled to be held from March 4 to 10 this year in Morocco. The Tanzania Golf Union (TGU) Chairman Joseph Tango named the golfers as Jay Nathwani, Manraj Singh, Alilaza Kermalli and Garv Chadha all from Arusha Gymkhana Club (AGC) and Isihaka Daudi who is from Tanzania People's Defence Forces (TPDF) Lugalo Golf Club. Tango said the preparation of the team's trip is on a top gear. "We want to send the winning team to this year's tournament, all players are in good health and hopefully, the golfers will represent well Tanzania in the event," said Tango. He added that selected players have already started training at Arusha and Lugalo golf courses. "Since there are all youth currently in schools, we have opted to let them train at their respective areas ahead of the tough battle at the junior level," he said. Tango said that AGC players will be under the former national team coach, and professional golfer, Olais Mollel while Athumani Chiundu will take care of Daudi training. Only Nathwani has an international competition exposure, having represented the country in the World Junior Golf Championship in Scotland. Nathwani also made his senior team debut at the East Africa Golf Challenge in 2016 and 2017 and was among the players in the team that finished second in the regional level tournament held at the Dar es Salaam Gymkhana Club (DGC). But, he assured Tanzanians that the young golfers will be in a good position after a twomonth training. Tanzania made its maiden appearance at the junior event in 2008 during the competition held in Mbabane, Swaziland when TGU were under Dioniz Malinzi Chairmanship. The team that made history was captained by Victor Joseph while others who were in the squad included Salim Ali, Aman Saidi and Christopher Andrew under former national team coach late Kenyan Charles Farrar.
