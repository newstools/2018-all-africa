Bongo flava star, Diamond Platnumz, secretly jetted into Nairobi on Thursday and managed to avoid media attention before leaving 'unnoticed'. Diamond was in Nairobi for Safaricom Dealers Party Awards that went down at the Carnivore Simba Saloon on Friday night before catching his flight back to Dar es Salaam in the afternoon. This was quite unlike Diamond, who likes sharing information about his location or what he is up to with his million fans on social media. During his short visit, Diamond was accompanied by his two trusted managers Sallam and Babu Tale, his bodyguard and four of his dancers. According to a close source, it was Safaricoms' idea to keep the party a secret because it was a private function. The crooner who is said to have been paid millions of shillings for the show was also in support of the idea as he was wanted to avoid the Kenyan media. DEALERS PARTY "Diamond did want anyone to know he was in the country, same as Safaricom who brought him in for their Dealers Party Award that happened at the Carnivore," the source told Nairobi News. "During the two days he was holed up in a 5 star hotel whose identity I can't reveal because this information is only known to his few handlers and if I'm to disclose it, I may blow up my cover and ruin my relationship with his team," the source further disclosed. Diamond's secret visit to Nairobi came after American rapper Rick Ross deleted all his photos on his Instagram account. The two are brand ambassadors for French sparkling wine Belaire. It is under these circumstances that they ended up meeting and doing a collabo Waka which Rick Ross never posted when it was released. Its is believed there could be some sort of beef as Huddah Monroe (another of East African Belaire ambassador) post on Rozzys' Instagram page is still intact.
