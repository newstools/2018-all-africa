The South African Under-19 team's hopes of winning the U19 Cricket World Cup was crushed by Pakistan on Wednesday.Pakistan won the match in Christchurch, New Zealand by three wickets after chasing down a meagre total posted by South Africa. The South Africans could only manage 189/9 off their allotted 50 overs, with wicketkeeper/batsman Wandile Makwetu top-scoring with 60 off 65 balls. Pakistan chased down their target with three wickets in hand and 13 balls remaining. Ali Zaryab Asif was their hero with 74 not out off 111 balls. South Africa's best bowler was off-spinner Jason Niemand, who took two for 31 in his 10 overs. The young Proteas will now enter the Plate Championship of the competition where they will play for, at best fifth position overall. They will wait for the result of the New Zealand/Afghanistan quarter-final to see who they will face this Saturday (January 27) in the Plate semi-final also to be held in Christchurch. Source: Sport24
