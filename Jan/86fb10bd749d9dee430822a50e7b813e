Today, at the 142nd session of the Executive Board meetings, the 34 members of the World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Board voted to grant PATH official relations status with WHO, giving PATH full participation rights in future Executive Board meetings and World Health Assemblies. A statement from PATH's Geneva Office Director Philippe Guinot follows: “As PATH celebrates 40 years of supporting global health innovation, we welcome the approval of our official relations status with the World Health Organization. We have enjoyed a very close and productive collaborative relationship with WHO, and look forward to continuing to work side-by-side toward the advancement of public health in the future.” About PATH PATH is the leader in global health innovation.
