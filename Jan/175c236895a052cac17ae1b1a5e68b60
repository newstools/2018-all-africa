Two people have been arrested to help police with their investigations into the beating of Ugandan musician Moses Ssekibogo, best known as Mowzey Radio of the Goodlyfe Crew. Radio who is currently receiving treatment at Case Hospital in Kampala was allegedly beaten into coma following a fight at De Bar, a local hang-out spot in Entebbe town on Monday. Police say Mr George Egesa, the proprietor of De Bar and his friend Xavier Rukere have been arrested and are currently detained at Entebbe main police station where a case file number SD REF 85/22/01/2018 has been opened as investigations continue. "We are still looking for one person, a key suspect who is on the run. He is the one who lifted Mowzey Radio up before letting him down hard," said Police spokesperson Emilian Kayima. Meanwhile, there have been reports circulating on social media indicating that the Neera singer is dead. However, Case Hospital management issued a statement saying: "Mowzey Radio was involved in an accident yesterday (Monday) and is currently receiving the very best treatment at Case Hospital. He is not deceased as previously rumoured. Please disregard any unnecessary reports." Kyaddodno East MP Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu popularly known as Bobi Wine who visited Radio in hospital on Tuesday said he was out of danger but his condition was serious. "Just came from Case Hospital to check on comrade Moses Radio. He is out of danger although his condition remains serious. Let us continue praying for him to get well soon," Mr Kyagulanyi who is also a singer tweeted.
