Euphraimu Paul Turaki, a local activist and youth leader in Numan, lamented the loss of innocent lives in the Sunday attack as well as displacement of many people from their homes, calling on the authorities to rise up to their responsibility of protecting the lives and belongings of the citizens. The police spokesman in Adamawa State, SP Othman Abubakar, said Mobile police had been deployed to the area to track down the assailants.
