This was the message from the Alan Winde, Minister of Economic Opportunities. "I hope all residents and tourists in the Western Cape are enjoying our province. It has been encouraging to see so many people out enjoying our beaches and key tourist landmarks this holiday season. This is also great for our tourism sector. "As we approach the new year celebrations this evening, I am calling on people to be safe on our roads, whether they are traveling in motor vehicles or bicycles or on foot. Don't drink and drive." Minister Winde added: "I would prefer that we not use fireworks in the Western Cape this new year as we are experiencing one of the worst droughts and our natural environment- which is tinder dry- is a big risk. We know that fire lanterns pose the same problem this year, and we are calling on people to work with us to reduce our fire risk this festive season.
