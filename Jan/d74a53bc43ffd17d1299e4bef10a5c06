The South African Democratic Teachers' Union (SADTU) would like to express its sincere condolences to Hugh Masekela's family, the rest of the country and the music fraternity. Bra Hugh Masekela brought to us music and became a cultural soldier; music is the fruit of life and preservation of our culture. His music played a pivotal role in our fight against apartheid and had a huge impact in uniting us. In our context as the teaching profession music is not only entertaining but it enhances development as a whole. Music as an art enhances intellectual development. We believe that Bra Hugh was an educationist as he changed people's lives and built the nation through music. His teachings, through music, was about all of us collaborating to free ourselves and teach our children about problem solving and creative thinking. He taught fellow musicians and the country about the dangers of drugs. Although we mourn Bra Hugh's death, we also pay tribute to this man who used his God given talent for the benefit of the country. Bra Hugh used his music to tell the world about apartheid atrocities. Through his music, he gave us hope and uplifted our spirits during those dark days. He made us laugh, cry and express our deepest feelings. We can never thank him enough for his selfless contribution to our struggle for a free and united South Africa. Bra Hugh has left a legacy for us to relate with our past struggles. He may be gone but his music will reverberate for generations to come. We believe that generations will continue to unite and serve humanity through the arts. May his soul rest in peace.
