Abuja â€” HUMANITARIAN agencies have appealed for US$157 million (R1,877 billion) to help over 250 000 people affected by the Boko Haram terror in Nigeria and neighbouring countries. The 47 United Nations agencies and humanitarian organisations, who have joined the 2018 Nigeria Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRRP), will cater for the needs of some 208 000 Nigerian refugees and 75 000 of host families in Cameroon, Chad and Niger. A similar appeal of $241 million was made for 2017 but only half was secured. "The Boko Haram crisis lingers on and is far from over," said United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Deputy High Commissioner Kelly Clements, said Niger's capital Niamey. "The world should not forget the victims of this deadly conflict, especially as there appears to be little hope for a return to peace and stability in the near future." Nigerian refugees continue to arrive in remote and impoverished communities in neighbouring countries. Since it intensified in 2013, the Boko Haram conflict has internally displaced 2,4 million people in northeast Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. An estimated 100 000 people have been killed. The countries are in the Lake Chad Basin. The Muslim insurgency has rendered over 7 million people in the region food insecure. "The future of young generations in the region is at stake, as food insecurity not only affects the dignity of families but has serious consequences on the physical and cognitive development of children," Clements said.
