Makurdi â€” The Benue State Universal Education Board (SUBEB) has said that at least 10, 000 pupils have been forced out of schools in two Local Government Areas of the state which came under attack by gunmen on New Year's day. Chairman of the Board, Rev Philip Tachin, said yesterday in Makurdi that schools were affected as many families fled their homes alongside children to take refuge in different camps following the invasion of Guma and Logo LGAs by gunmen. Tachin lamented that the development had become a serious setback to the board which recently embarked on massive campaign for increased enrolment of pupils into public primary schools in the state at the commencement of new academic session few months ago. He said it was disheartening to see hundreds of school children forced out of school by the invasion of suspected herders on some communities in Guma and Logo area when he paid a visit to the camp few days ago to donate relief materials. "The Executive Secretary of State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) gave me a staggering statistics of children numbering 2,050 who are locked up in this camp in Gbajimba. Apart from these children from the rural areas that have been camped here, the primary school in Gbajimba has also been shut down to accommodate the refugees since there are no enough IDPs camps. "This is the multiplier effect of this genocidal operation. There are six IDPs camps in these two affected local government areas and if the statistics of these school children are the same across the IDPs camps, over 10,000 children have been forced out of school," he said. Tachin worried that the gunmen who apparently have no value for education were on a mission to destroy education.
