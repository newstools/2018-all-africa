A picture of Starehe Member of Parliament Charles Njagua alias Jaguar deep in prayers in church has thrilled netizens. The legislator had joined Deputy President William Ruto and other leaders during the ordination of pastor Anne Ndeti at Redeemed Gospel Church in Jericho Makadara Constituency. Others were Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wa and nominated legislator Maina Kamanda, among others. But during prayers, while the rest have held their hands in supplication, Jaguar is seen closing his eyes firmly and nearly clenching his fists. The picture was shared on Facebook by Sonko, leaving his followers amused. Eric Okoth said: "Jaguar wacha zako mzae, unajiangalia kwa kioo nn?" Nancy Aswetoh wondered: "Jaguar ni Kama amekazwa na mnyambo?" Alecky Katalyst went on: "Kuna wale wako ndani ya maombi wengine wanakaa wako radar." Serah Paul Ngai posed: "kwani jaguar ako wapi ama amejazwa na holy spirit?" Antony W Kimani also wondered: "Kwani jaguar Analia?" Daniel Isiye Chawe also quipped: "Jaguar ako two centimeters away from the prayers."
