The United Nations has called on Kenyan authorities to stop forceful evictions of the Sengwer tribe living in the Embobut forest in Kenya. At least 15 homes and some livestock were destroyed when over 100 armed forest service guards entered the traditional lands of the Sengwer. This tribe has been fighting with the Kenyan government for the right to live in the Embobut forest in the Cherengany Hills for over five decades.
