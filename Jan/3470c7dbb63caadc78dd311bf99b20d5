THE Government has engaged the Business Regulatory Review Agency (BRRA) to ascertain the regulatory impact of the Statutory Instrument (SI) to shift transportation of 30 per cent of bulk cargoes from road to rail. Transport and Communications Minister Brian Mushimba said the SI to shift 30 per cent of bulk cargo from road to rail was drafted and the ministry had engaged the BRRA to ascertain its regulatory impact on business. Mr Mushimba said in a statement released in Lusaka yesterday that the way forward on the SI would be known after BRRA ascertaining the impact on business. He said the feasibility study report for the Brownfield projects of revamping Zambia Railways Limited (ZRL) and Tanzania Zambia Railway (TAZARA) had been completed. Mr Mushimba said from the feasibility study, two sections of Mulobezi to Kafue and Kafue to Chililabombwe were completed and approved at an estimated cost of US$2 billion. Cabinet last year approved the proposal for Government to acquire 30 per cent shares in North-Western Railway Company which would formally commence the construction of Chingola - Jimbe Railway project under Public Private Partnership Agreement (PPP) arrangement. Mr Mushimba further said the Ministry strengthened its early warning systems to help farmers prevent and mitigate against climate related hazards such as floods, extreme temperatures and prolonged dry spell. He said the Ministry also started the development of a strategic plan for improvement and sustainability of meteorological service provision in Zambia with the support of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).
