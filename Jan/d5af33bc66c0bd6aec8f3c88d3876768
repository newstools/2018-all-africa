The Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., Mr Ambrose Omordion, attributed Forte Oil's loss for two straight years to non-payment of dividend in 2016 financial year and weak earnings. Mr. Omordion said that mixed performance posted by the company in 2017 and unclear business plan or direction to investing public on the happenings in the company or where it was heading to, contributed to the development. He also attributed the University Press depreciation to dwindling dividend payout and unimpressive numbers, as increasing cottage industries operation continued to affect its bottom line.

Mr. Omordion linked Dangote Sugar growth to improved numbers and 50k interim dividend as a result of backward integration that reduced operating cost due to sugarcane farms. He also attributed the International Breweries gain to its merger with Intafact Beverages Ltd and Pabod Breweries Ltd as the major factor that move the price as earnings remained weak He said that infusion of the three major players would boost numbers as market share increases. Omordion said that Fidelity Bank's growth was due to oversubscription of its Eurobond, which boosted investors' confidence and as well improved positive numbers. (NAN)
