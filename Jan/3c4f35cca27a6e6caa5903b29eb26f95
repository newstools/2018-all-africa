Nairobi â€” Nairobi Police chief Japheth Koome now says they have not received any notification from Opposition coalition NASA over its planned swearing in of Raila Odinga on Tuesday. Koome said police will seal off Uhuru Park, which will be a no-go zone as part of security measures in the capital. Last week, the Nairobi County Government announced that it has closed Uhuru Park for major renovations and therefore, will not issue permits for any event there this week. With the county government statement and today's announcement from Koome, a showdown is clearly looming after NASA insisted on carrying out the event at the historic grounds.
