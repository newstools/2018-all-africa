The transition from one year to another is traditionally known for two things: reflecting and planning. Thus, as another New Year begins rolling by, we bring you what some female celebrities have up their sleeves for the year 2018. Helen Paul, Comedian & actress For the New Year, I am simply believing God for the best and I am hoping that all things will work together for my good. With that in mind, my New Year resolution is to forge ahead unabashed and without the fear of challenges or obstacles. Simply put, I will pursue excellence in a bold manner. Yewande Lawal, Actress What I intend to consciously do henceforth in this New Year, is to pay more attention to putting myself first. Team self-love. Lol! I will let go of the things I cannot control and also worry less. Muma Gee, Actress and singer My plan for the New Year is basically to project and release AWS (African Woman Skilashi). It's a song for the reappraisal of womanhood in Africa. Also, my culture TV/documentary project will be unveiled this year. From the 12th of January to 11th of February, 2018, I shall be spending a better part of my time in a Celebrity Reality TV Show. Finally, I have a lot of giving back projects through my Muma Gee Foundation through which I hope to help women realise who they are and what they are created for by God. Doris Simeon, Actress, presenter I am grateful for another year, first and foremost. And I must say I have loads of plans for the New Year. The first is to release my two movies True Betrayal and Alone in the Dark. After that, I will be starting two TV shows. Other plans will be unveiled as the year rolls by. Nse Ikpe Etim, Actress I never have been able to make New Year resolutions and stick to them, so, this New Year, I accept the things I cannot change and make an effort to be a better person; not losing my grounding and humanity. That said, I am looking forward to a colourful year.
