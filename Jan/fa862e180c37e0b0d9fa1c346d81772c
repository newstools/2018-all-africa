"The Ministry of Health and Quality of Life is working on the modalities for the setting up of a 150-bed eye hospital in RÃ©duit, which is expected to be completed within two years' time." This announcement was made by the Minister of Health and Quality of Life, Dr Anwar Husnoo, yesterday at the donation of equipment by the Teaching Eye Surgery (T.E.S) Foundation of Switzerland to the Ophthalmology Department of Souillac Hospital. According to Dr Husnoo, the setting up of a new modern eye hospital is essential so as to reduce patient overload at Subramania Bharathi Eye Hospital in Moka, and address the increasing health consequences associated with an ageing population and the complications related to high prevalence of diabetes, mainly diabetic retinopathy. He highlighted the successful partnership of the Ministry of Health and Quality of Life with T.E.S Foundation which has yielded positive results since its inception in 2006 and thanked the Foundation for its collaboration in improving service delivery for the betterment of Mauritian patients. During the 12 years of cooperation, some 500 patients have undergone corneal transplants; the eye hospital in Moka and the Ophthalmology Department in Souillac Hospital have received latest ultrasound machines and probes and other biometric equipment; and local doctors have been able to acquire latest surgery techniques from international experts. The Minister moreover commended the efforts of the staff of Souillac Hospital where 5,227 cataract surgeries have been carried out since the coming into operation of the Ophthalmology services in January 2015. He added that the expert team from T.E.S Foundation praised the staff for their efficiency and assistance while the team was performing surgical procedures at the hospital.
