Lagos â€” There are indications that the December 2018 deadline for the completion of the Lagos - Ibadan standard gauge project may not be feasible following avalanche of challenges and obstructions which have stalled smooth pace of work. Some of the obstructions include the various water pipes, gas pipelines, bridges, among others. While the federal and Lagos state governments have agreed to demolish two obstructing bridges in Lagos, the Ministry of Transportation is still interfacing with relevant authorities to remove other obstructions on the right of way. Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi while briefing newsmen after the monthly meeting of the Project Implementation Committee with the China Civil Engineering and Construction Company (CCECC), the contractors handling the $1.5bn project, declared that they were now "battling with time schedule." Our correspondent observed many residents whose houses were consumed by the right of way removing the rooftops, blocks and other useful materials from the houses before they were demolished. The minister said the government had settled property owners whose houses were affected in order to clear the land for the smooth take-off of the project. Asked when the laying of tracks would commence, the minister said this would be determined when all issues of right of way were sorted, adding that the Ministry was collaborating with relevant stakeholders including the Lagos and Ogun state government officials to address the challenges.
