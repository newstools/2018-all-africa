President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday assured Nigerians that the rising attacks on communities by herdsmen would soon be brought under control by security forces deployed to the vulnerable areas across the country. He said the unfortunate incident of attacks, which had resulted in loss of lives and properties, had already brought sorrow and hardship on many Nigerians, with the government deeply affected. Buhari, according to his spokesman Mr Femi Adesina, said this at the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja on Monday while receiving the Board of Directors of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group. President Buhari, however, did not explain how the attacks affected his government.
