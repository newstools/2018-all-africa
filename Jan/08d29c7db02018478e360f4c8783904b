The WMO representative, Mr. Bernard Gomez also appealed to NiMet to take Sierra Leone meteorological organisation under its wings as an understudy, to learn the art of incorporating and engaging policy makers into the management and implementation of its country's meteorological products like the NiMet Seasonal Rainfall Prediction (SRP). Responding, the Director-General/CEO, NiMet, Professor Sani Abubakar Mashi, while reiterating the desire of NiMet to be a world class Meteorological Organisation, also assured WMO of NiMet's continued support to other African country's struggling meteorological organisations, especially Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Professor Sani Abubakar Mashi also promised to aid the WMO implementation of the Host country agreement in Nigeria with WMO, thereby empowering the World Meteorological body to undertake more expansions in order to improve meteorological services in the country.
