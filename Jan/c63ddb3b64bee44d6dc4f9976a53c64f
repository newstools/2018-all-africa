The Delta State government has invited leaders of the Niger Delta Avengers for talks in a bid to ensure that the recent threat by the militant group to resume attacks on oil facilities is not carried out. The militants have renewed a call for the restructuring of the country, threatening to resume hostilities in the oil-rich region if the demand is not carried out.
