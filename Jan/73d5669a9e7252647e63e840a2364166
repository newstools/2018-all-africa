Abuja â€” The Federal Government has set up a committee to transform the powers of Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PRESCOM) to the prescribed National Commission (NATCOM). Chairman of PRESCOM, Ambassador Emmanuel Imohe in Abuja, said the decision is to fast track the process to fight the illicit proliferation of arms not only in Nigeria but also with ECOWAS member states and development partners. He said because of the regional dimension of the problem of Boko Haram, "it is not possible for any one nation to tackle the problem," urging member states to step up their collaboration efforts in order to contain the threat. According to him, the quest for development in Nigeria and the region could only be guaranteed in an atmosphere free of crisis and conflicts, to interact, share information and promote best practices in the fight against illicit weapons. ECOWAS Commission's Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security, Mrs. Halima Ahmed, informed the participants that the highlight of the activities engaged in by sub region is in waging war against SALW. Represented by Director for Peacekeeping and Regional Security, Dr. Cyriaque Agnehethom, recalled that Small Arms Division hosted experts in its effort to develop the regional database and national register which are key tools in sustaining and winning fight against illegal weapons. She also explained, the on-going ECOWAS-EU Small Arms Project, which is being implemented in seven member states of Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Mali, Niger and Nigeria. Also, Permanent Secretary of National Commission of Togo, Mr. Jonas Paka, said they are satisfied on the existence of the platform, adding, ECOWAS was able to make the annual meeting happen since the last one held in Calabar two years ago.
