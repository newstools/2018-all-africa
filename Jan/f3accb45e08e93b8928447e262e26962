The newly-elected leader of South Africa's ruling African National Congress, Cyril Ramaphosa, has intervened to clean up the state-owned electricity utility ahead of leading the country's team to the 2018 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos from January 23.  Faced with a warning from Minister of Finance Malusi Gigaba that the debt-ridden company was unable to raise money and could bring down government finances, the government appointed a new board and ordered the removal of top executives implicated in corruption.
