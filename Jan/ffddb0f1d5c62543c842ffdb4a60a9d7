CULTURE is what brings people together, gives them a sense of identity and often a rich heritage to cherish. With his 15-track album, 'Madhiladhilo Pamwe Niilonga', Shoxlela aims to celebrate his culture and traditions through his music. From the album cover, it is evident the young singer from Ondangwa is proud of who he is and where he comes from and this can be felt through the energy on most of his tracks as well. A well thought-out musical project by the artist delivers a cohesive collection of tracks where African drums, strings and other percussion instruments can be heard throughout, however each track is arranged slightly differently. While most of the songs are traditional, Shoxlela adds his own modern twist which is a refreshing element to his style. On some occasions, the vocals come across as a bit pitchy, especially from the back-up singer on 'Koshipale', an unfortunate incident to have made its way onto the album. However, the enthusiasm makes up where other aspects fall short. The upbeat album serves as insight to a culture and ultimately tells a story about the artist; this is important in music as no one wants to experience empty noise which will soon be forgotten. One drawback might be the number of tracks on the album. For music with similiar instrumentation and adaptions, after a few tracks, the sound becomes rather repetitive and could come off as annoying. A shorter track list with more diversity would have been a better option. Track 11, 'Quarana', is significantly more enjoyable than the other tracks due to its catchy nature. For a youngster who is proud of his heritage and puts that same pride and love in his music, I would say Shoxlela did a pretty good job. With more experience and growth, he should be an exciting talent in future.
