Since last week, Visionscape has scaled up its waste evacuation operations in major areas in the state. Tonnes of heaps in Falomo Bridge, Ikoyi, Mushin, Agege, Oshodi, Obalende and Ikorodu,among other locations, have been cleared. The firm also commenced distribution of waste bags to residents in order to ensure effective disposal and collection of waste from households, starting from Igando-Ikotun Local Council Development Area (LCDA). Residents are expected to bag their waste properly in the bags and dispose them in waste bins.

Also, the firm participated in cleanup of Makoko community, a neighbourhood on the coast of Lagos mainland, popularly characterized as a slum, with a dense population, which faces one of the greatest environmental problems - sewage and solid waste.During the cleanup, powered by Unilever, Visionscape joined forces with RecyclePoints, a waste and recycling social venture, to touch on the issues of poor sanitation in the area and encourage residents to keep their community clean.
