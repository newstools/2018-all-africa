A South African delegation led by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says it will use the 2018 World Economic Forum to restore investor confidence in the South African economy. The delegation's goals seek to counteract the effect of rating agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's following their downgrade of the local economy to "junk" status due to the division within the ruling African National Congress, an aspect the financial bodies believe threatened the prospect of economic growth.
