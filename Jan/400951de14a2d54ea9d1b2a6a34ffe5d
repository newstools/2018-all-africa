Swedish retailer, H&M, has apologised for their racial slur hoodie advertorial. In the ad, a young black model wears the $7.99 hoodie which has an inscription of "coolest monkey in the jungle" embezzled on it while a young white model wears another hoodie. Although outraged members of the public claim that it is an intentional act, H & M has tendered an apology in a statement available to American television channel, Fox News: "We sincerely apologize for offending people with this image of a printed hooded top. The image has been removed from all online channels and the product will not be for sale in the United States... We believe in diversity and inclusion in all that we do and will be reviewing all our internal policies accordingly to avoid any future issues." "Deeply offended" Canadian music producer and songwriter, The Weeknd, has said that he will stop working with the retail store. He has a clothing line at the retail store. Despite taking down the ad, time will tell if they will be forgiven by the black community.
