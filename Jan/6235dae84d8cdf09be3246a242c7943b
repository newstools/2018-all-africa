Television siren Joy Doreen Biira appears to have put her news anchoring days behind her after taking up a new job with Kenya's Ministry of Mining. Ms Biira is reported to have made the transition from a news anchor to her new position of Advisor, Strategic Communications at the ministry towards the end of last year. The Ugandan journalist started her career as an unpaid volunteer/intern and was later employed as a week day Morning Show co-host at NBS Television with Shawn Kimuli, broadcasting at the network's headquarters in Kampala, Uganda. In 2008 she relocated to Kenya to work as the weekend Breakfast Show at Capital FM. She later joined Standard Media Group in January 2012 as a news anchor and reporter with KTN. STOLEN CAR But her stocks in the media started falling in December 2016 when it was reported that her car had been stolen from the Standard Group premises along Mombasa road. Days later the car was recovered in Kisumu and Aaron Obudho Ochieng, an editor at Standard Media Group, charged with the theft of the Sh2.8 Mercedes Benz. But the case would take a strange twist when Mr Ochieng confessed that the car's disappearance was a planned theft. In his statement to the police, Mr Ochieng claimed that he and Biira had agreed to have the vehicle reported as missing in order to sell it and use the proceeds to purchase another vehicle.
