If there is a person who has been missing lately on Betty Kyallo's timeline is her BFF and business partner Susan Kaittany. Betty and Susan were inseparable in the beginning of 2017 after they launched their executive salon, Posh Palace Hair Studio & Spa, in December 2016. Interestingly, photos of the two girlfriends have since been deleted from Kyallo's Instagram page where she had shared dozens. NO LONGER HANGOUT What is even more puzzling is that the two are no longer travel buddies as was the case in the past and Betty has now turned to her mother, who was her travel partner in her latest Mombasa vacation. At their salon, employees say all is not well with their bosses with an employee, who sought anonymity, revealing that the two no longer hangout together. The two used to share brunches, lunches and dinners at News Caf√©, a place where they no longer hangout.
