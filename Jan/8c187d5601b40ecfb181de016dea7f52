The Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) is a continental initiative aimed at addressing the infrastructure deficit that is severely hampering Africa's competitiveness in the world market. PIDA promotes regional economic integration by building mutually beneficial infrastructure and strengthening the ability of countries to trade and establish regional value chains for increased competitiveness. The Third PIDA Week was held from 10 to 14 December 2017 in Swakopmund, Namibia under the theme "Regional Infrastructure Development for Job Creation and Economic Transformation".
