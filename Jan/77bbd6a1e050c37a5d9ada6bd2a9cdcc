THE tourism industry in Luapula province will create thousands jobs for the local people this year because of the planned extensive promotion, Luapula Minister Nickson Chilangwa has said. Mr Chilangwa said the province has beautiful tourist attraction sites which will be promoted worldwide to attract tourists and create jobs for the people. He said the province was poised for massive development, a clear indication of Government's commitment to improve certain sectors of the economy. Mr Chilangwa added that the promotion of the tourism sector would immediately result in many jobs and reduce unemployment levels. The province was considering the sand beaches on the shores of lakes, Bangweulu, Mweru Wantipa, Lumangwe, Ntumbacushi and Mambilima falls including Kilwa caves as some of the attractive tourist attractions. The minister added that the provincial administration would extensively advertise different sites not known to the outside world. He said it was unacceptable that available tourist sites in the province continued to be under utilised when they could create jobs. He said the Patriotic Front Government was in a hurry to transform the county and its people hence any necessary investments aimed at uplifting the welfare of the people would be implemented.
