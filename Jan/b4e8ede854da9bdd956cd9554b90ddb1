According to the Tanzanian government data, the number of pregnancies in girls aged between 15 - 19 continues to rise - increasing from 23% in 2010 to 27% in 2015. Expelling teenage girls from schools after falling pregnant may not be the best approach to reducing teenage pregnancy in schools instead support and training for those working with girls to de-stigmatise conversations about sexuality may be the solution.
