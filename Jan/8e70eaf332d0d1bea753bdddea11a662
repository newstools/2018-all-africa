Kampala â€” The Army has disputed reports regarding the release of Boda Boda 2010 patron, Abdallah Kitatta, who was arrested by the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence (CMI) in the ongoing hunt for killers of Case Clinic accountant, Francis Ekalungar. Army and defence spokesperson, Brig Richard Karemire, confirmed to this reporter that Mr Kitatta, who doubles as the NRM chairman for Rubaga Division, Kampala was still in custody following earlier reports that he had been released. "I have sent a message and I have confirmed he is still in our custody," Brig Karemire said. Army said on Tuesday that Mr Kitatta and 30 others who were arrested at the weekend would be arraigned before court as soon as investigations are complete. Mr Kitatta was apprehended on Saturday, a day after his young brother Huzairu Kiwalabye was arrested as one of the suspects in the kidnap and killing of Ekalungar on January 2. Ekalungar's charred body was found at Kajjansi on Entebbe Road on January 3, this year. CMI has since directly linked Mr Kiwalabye to the gruesome murder. Lt Col Deo Akiiki on Monday explained that Mr Kitatta was arrested for trying to sabotage CMI investigation by use of threats, protests and blocking roads. He said army could not allow him to interfere with its investigations.
