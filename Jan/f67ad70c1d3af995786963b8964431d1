The prescriptions of the Firearms Control Act are being followed in this regard and pending the outcome thereof charges of negligent loss of firearms/ or failure to report the loss of firearms will be added for investigation.

The general public is urged to report about illegal firearms to Crime Stop or the provincial offices of the NBIFCPVC which are established countrywide within the Hawks.
