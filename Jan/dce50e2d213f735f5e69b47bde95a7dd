"We are aware that the new National Minimum Wage for Nigerian workers is long overdue. I therefore, call on the tripartite Committee on Minimum wage to fast track its work in order to put smiles on the faces of the suffering Nigerian workers as justice delayed is justice denied, and so minimum wage delayed is minimum wage denied," he said.
