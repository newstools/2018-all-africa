Nairobi â€” The European Parliament is on Tuesday expected to debate the situation in Kenya after last year's elections. Through her Twitter handle, Head of the EU Observer Mission to Kenya during last year's General Election Marietje Schaake said the debate will focus on the current political environment following the polls. The debate follows the release of an election report last week, a move the government protested since it had no input in it and termed it unprocedural, condescending, and disdainful. Schaake released the findings in Brussels, Belgium and immediately attracted the ire of Kenya's ambassador to Belgium and the EU, Johnson Weru.
