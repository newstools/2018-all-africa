Comedian Eric Omondi has pulled a romantic stunt that many men in Nairobi will struggle to match up by posting videos and a photo of the grand homecoming that he accorded his fiancée, Chantal Grazioli, who was returning from a trip aboard. Being the man who never shies off from surprising his woman, Eric chose to put up a billboard with a special message to Chantal on one of the roads leading out of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The comedian also shared a video that shows him and two other men pushing Chantal on a luggage trolley when she was checking out of the airport. At some point Eric removes a chewing gum from his mouth, clumsily looks for a place to dispose it, and after failing to get an appropriate disposal area he sticks it on the metallic rails of the trolley. He then bends forward and plants a kiss on Chantal's lips.
