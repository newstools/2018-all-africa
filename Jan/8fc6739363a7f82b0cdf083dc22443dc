THE Zambian youth should be proactive and engage themselves in small businesses or any other income-generating ventures that can sustain their lives, a Church minister has said. Deeper Life Bible Ministries Church national overseer John Amoni said all youths in the country needed to be proactive in finding decent ways of sustaining their lives. He urged youths not to be lazy and be moving about, but to be productive by engaging themselves in some works that would help in their living. Pastor Amoni said in Lusaka recently that those youths who were lazy were even likely to involve themselves in immoral and illicit vices. "I would like to appeal to all our youths in the country to venture into some kind of business in order for them to entrepreneur and supporting themselves in their daily living," Pastor Amoni said. He said a youth with real entrepreneurial mind could start with a small capital and eventually grow bigger and successful. Pastor Amoni said God-fearing mind would make a youth success and do better things in life. He urged all youths to trust in God and work hard to earn their livelihood instead of being busy-bodies. "The Bible doesn't want lazy people, so us the church we always teach all our youths to involve themselves in some kind of income generating ventures to sustain themselves," he said.
