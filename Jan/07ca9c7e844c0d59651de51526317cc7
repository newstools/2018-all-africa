Keroche Breweries Heiress Anerlisa Muigai celebrated her 30th birthday at the weekend in style in an exclusive invite-only party that was attended by renowned personalities in Nairobi. The white and gold themed lavish party featured a six tier mega cake and exquisite d√©cor at an undisclosed venue. Among the guests were Anerlisa's new beau Don, family and close friends. Some of the celebrities who attended the party include, media personalities Betty Kyallo, Lilian Muli, Janet Mbugua and Governor Mike Sonko's first born daughter, Saumu Mbuvi. Anerlisa officially turned 30 on January 9 when she took to social media to inform her fans about her major milestone in life. At the time, the Nero CEO shared her worries as to what turning 30 would bring. "My God I don't know why I am so scared yet I know I have achieved quite a bit for my age, 29 years though has been the craziest year and one that I never thought I'd get through. Someone told me that I'll now be on 3rd floor and I thought does that mean I am becoming gacucu or does that mean people expect a lot more from me. I won't lie, I am so scared," she wrote then.
