One of the world's largest diamonds has been found in the Letseng mine in Lesotho, a small country surrounded by South Africa. The diamond was found by UK mining company Gem Diamonds and could be worth up to $40 million. A 910-carat diamond thought to be the fifth largest in the world has been found in the small southern African nation of Lesotho, diamond mining company Gem Diamonds said on Monday. The diamond miner uncovered the D-color stone at the Letseng mine and described the 910-carat diamond as being of "exceptional quality." "The diamond, the largest recovered from Letseng, is believed to be the fifth largest gem-quality diamond ever recovered," a Gem Diamonds statement said.
