Owerri â€” A former governor of Imo State, Chief Ikedi Ohakim, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle the menacing herdsmen's attack on Nigerians with swift dispatch as he handled the proscribed non-violent Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) who did not kill any soul but still tagged a terror organisation by the government. Ohakim made the remarks while congratulating the country's military on the Nigerian Armed Forces Remembrance Day that was held across the country on Monday. He recalled the sacrifices of the soldiers, saying that on daily basis they put their lives on the line to protect our country's territorial integrity, adding that the sacrifices the men of the Armed Forces make should be emulated by every Nigerian, especially those in the public service, as such is the height of patriotism. He called on the president, governors and other elected leaders at all levels to commit to elevating the Armed Forces Remembrance Day from a mere ritual of speech making and laying of wreaths to formulating better welfare packages and conditions of service to the soldiers who risk all to protect the country and advocated that a special scheme be established to take care of the families of the fallen heroes, saying that it would boost the morale of the soldiers. Ohakim, however, expressed shock at the rising tide of insecurity across the country, wandering why the menace of herdsmen should not be tackled with the kind of speed and force the Armed Forces tackled the IPOB.
