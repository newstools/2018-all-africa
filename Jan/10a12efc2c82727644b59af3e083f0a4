Shuga Band, a Lagos-based 14 piece group, led by Shuga (Akinloye Tofowomo) is ready to roll out the drums as it celebrates 20 years of undiluted live music performances in Nigeria. The Band, which was established about 20 years ago after Shuga's exit from Pintus, an upscale bar in the highbrow Allen Avenue, Ikeja, back in the days, remains one of the best bands that had maintained a high standard of live music performances.Best known for her up-tempo secular flair, swing-beat, RnB , dance tunes, oldies, country, traditional, soulful arrangements among others, Shuga band is not only rated as one of Nigeria's number one functioning bands, but also as a group committed to the highest standard of excellence and professionalism. According to Akinloye Tofowomo, "This year, the Shuga Band will be celebrating 20 years of professional and undiluted live music in Nigeria. It will be an all-year celebration and we sure can't wait to dish out activities we have lined out for you." A widely travelled band, the band has featured in many high profile events such as ECOWAS Heads of States Dinner, Mike Adenuga's daughter's wedding among others. It consists of young and talented musicians who see music more as a passion than a trade. They bridge the gap between the young and the old at parties, rendering legendary old school tunes and blending them with African flavours. It is expected, 2018 will be a bumper year for the group.
