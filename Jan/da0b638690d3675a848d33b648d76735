He was accompanied on the trip by the Director-General of National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) Julie Okah-Donli, and the Comptroller General of Nigeria Immigration Service, Muhammad Babandede. Also on the trip was the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Foreign Affairs and Diaspora, Abike Dabiri-Erewa. The move came after the repatriation of hundreds of Nigerians from Libya by Federal Government in December 2017 in conjunction with the International Office for Migration (IOM).
