A video has emerged online showing Bongo singer Diamond Platnumz and his old flame model Wema Sepetu getting cozy at an event organized by the crooner's music record label Wasafi. The clip begins with Diamond giving Wema a lengthy hug and then proceeds to greet the people around. He then takes his attention back to Wema, holding her on the shoulders. Wema reciprocates the embrace by placing her hand on the singer's waist. The two engage in small talk and at one point Diamond is seen pushing Wema's head to rest on his chest, while they continue whispering in each other's ears.
