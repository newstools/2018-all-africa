There were emotional scenes at a church in Kayole, Nairobi on Saturday when a 27-year-old woman recounted her long search for the father she never knew. Rose Muthoni Amboko, 27, grew up not knowing who her father was, but her endless efforts to trace the man who fathered her finally bore fruit. She narrated how she did everything possible to connect with her father whom she never knew since birth. Her long search involved questioning her mother and the use of Facebook and other online platforms. SONG AND DANCE Finally, a phone call put her through to a man by the name Phillip Likuya Amboko who turned out to be her father. Strangely, the father, a teacher who lived Kayole, recalled Rose's mother, although he was not aware that he had fathered a child with her. An so on an emotional Saturday, filled with song and dance, the two finally met. Rose, who says her mother never gave her the chance to know her dad, urged all single mothers to allow their children to know their fathers as it's not right for a child to grow not knowing who his or her father. Phillip also called upon all men to be responsible for the children they sire, whether they are ready for fatherhood or not.
