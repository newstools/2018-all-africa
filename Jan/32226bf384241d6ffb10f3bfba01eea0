Sokoto â€” No fewer than 100 police officers are currently undergoing training on counter terrorism in Sokoto State. The Assistant Inspector General (AIG) of Police Zone 10, Yakubu Usman, made this known at the National Counter Terrorism Incident Site Commander's Management Course in Sokoto yesterday. He said the aim of the training was to build the capacity and competence of the police officers to be able to respond to any act of terrorism in the country in line with global practices. According to him, the three-day training was apt as terrorism has assumed a global dimension and a threat to humanity. "The importance of this course cannot be over emphasised. We cannot pretend that we are not aware of what is happening across the globe. "That is why the need to train officers on counter terrorism became necessary in order to respond to current realities and challenges,"he said. He reaffirmed the commitment of the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris towards effective policing to make the country safe. In a remark, the State Commissioner of Police, Alhaji Murtala Usman Mani, said the training was meant to equip officers with the right knowledge to combat terrorism in the country. He said the participants included not only police officers but from other security agencies in the zone. "The current leadership of the police force is committed to safety of the citizens. That is why we have participants from other security agencies because we need synergy in order to combat criminal and terrorist acts. "Those who are trained are expected to transmit it to the junior officers who are not opportune to be here for the counter terrorism training," he added.
