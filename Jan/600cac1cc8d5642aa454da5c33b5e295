Other housemates are Rico Swavey, Bito, BamBam, Leo, Khloe, Angel and Ifu-Ennada, Anto, Tobi Bakare, Cee-C and Lolu. The Bay show is running for a second consecutive running year as it had previously suffered a 10-year hiatus after holding its first edition in 2006. Popular artists, Mayorkun and Kiss Daniel performed live during the launch. Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, who returned to host the show for the second time, introduced the housemates in groups of four.

A reunion show featuring some of the previous housemates had been aired for one week before Sunday's launch. Every Sunday on the show, viewers are expected to witness an eviction of a housemate. The winner of the 78 - day contest will be given N45 million cash prize and a brand new SUV car. Big Brother Naija, which was introduced in 2006, is a special Nigerian version of the continental show Big Brother Africa.
