According to Margaret Mathore, Channel Head Maisha Magic East, people hear a lot of stories about leading personalities in the country, but none has ever gone as in depth as Stori Yangu will go. "All myths and rumors will be dispelled through this show as the stories will be told by the personalities themselves," she said.

Stori Yangu will explore these through creating a real connection with leading personalities from across Kenya who have contributed to different industries and causes in the country.
