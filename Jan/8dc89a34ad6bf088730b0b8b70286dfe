According to Lolade Adewuyi, chief strategist at CampsBay Media, "In a world where social media continues to play a big role, the influence of African entertainers and footballers, the cr√®me of popular culture on our continent, continues to fascinate and that is why we have compiled this list" "We have tried as much as possible to gather the top African pop and sport stars into the list in order to show their influence across the three key social media platforms of Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. We hope that the Power Report will be an annual ranking to gauge their growing impact as well as enable market planners and researchers to see the possibilities inherent in their influence." Personalities from 12 countries are represented on the list with the top 10 places filled by Akon, Salah, footballer Didier Drogba, Moroccan stand-up comedian Gad el Maleh, South African comedian and TV show host Trevor Noah, Cameroonian footballer Samuel Eto'o, Moroccan actor Jamel Debbouze, Nigerian singer Davido and South African actress Charlize Theron.
