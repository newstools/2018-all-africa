Ugandan music vocalist Moses Ssekibogo alias Moze Radio is in coma at Case Hospital after he suffered serious injuries on his neck this morning. Radio sustained the injuries at Sky Lounge in Kololo where he was reportedly involved in a bar fight with one of the bouncers who beat him up to the extent that he fell and hit his head on the floor thus breaking his neck. He was then rushed to Nsambya Hospital where doctors declined to admit him because the hospital's Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was full. His friends then transferred him to Case Clinic on Buganda Road, Kampala where he's undergoing treatment. We shall keep you posted on other developments as they come in but at the moment, the 'Neera' musician is still in coma.
