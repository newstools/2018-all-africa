As a result of incessant kidnapping and cattle rustling in some parts of Niger State, the military authorities have deployed a special squad to the state to dislodge the criminals. Indication to this effect came to light yesterday when the General Officer commanding 1 Mechanized Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Major Gen Mohammed Mohammed, led other top military officers to intimate the acting Governor, Alhaji Ahmed Mohammed Ketso, at Government House on the development. Other on the GOC's team were Garrison Commander, Major Gen Odiakor, Col. Yau, who represented Commander Signals and Staff Officer of the GOC, Col. Obayo. The team had separate meetings with the Acting Governor, Alhaji Ketso and Secretary to the state Government, Alhaji Isah Ladan, before leaving the Government House. They were accompanied by five loads of heavily armed Soldiers. Journalists were shut out of the meetings, but Vanguard gathered that the mission of the military top brass to the state is tagged "Operation Yaki" aimed at dislodging the criminals from the state. It was also gathered that the operation would be led by the GOC Commander, General Mohammed Mohammed, though the date for the commencement of the operation is still hazy. There have been incessant cases of kidnapping and cattle rustling in the state in the past few months heightening insecurity in the state. Three Local Government Areas mostly affected are Shiroro, Munyan and Rafi.
