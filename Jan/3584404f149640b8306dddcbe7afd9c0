She's back! Brenda Blethyn returns to ITV Choice (DStv 123) as the unorthodox but brilliantly perceptive DCI Vera Stanhope, investigating more chilling crimes in four two-hour episodes starting on Wednesday, January 10 at 20:00. Actor Kenny Doughty also returns to his role as Vera's logical right hand man, Detective Sergeant Aiden Healy, who has worked hard to earn her respect and prove his worth on the team. Completing Vera's team is Jon Morrison as DC Kenny Lockhart, Riley Jones as DC Mark Edwards and Kingsley Ben-Adir who plays Pathologist Marcus Summer. The series has once again been inspired by the best-selling novels and characters created by acclaimed crime writer Ann Cleeves, who recently received the Diamond Dagger Award at the Crime Writer's Association for a lifetime achievement of sustained excellence. In the first episode DCI Vera Stanhope is called to a chilling murder scene when the charred remains of a body are discovered in an abattoir incinerator. With limited forensic evidence, she is disturbed to identify the body as DC Harry Fenton, a respected police officer from the Northumberland & City Fraud Unit. Vera and Aiden (Kenny Doughty) meet Harry's grieving family and friends in a tightly -knit fishing community who are shocked to learn of the devastating murder. Vera looks to Harry's fraud team to try and find answers, but she begins to sense that all is not what it seems. One of Harry's former colleagues continues to rub Vera up the wrong way by poking her nose into the investigation. Whereas DC Jac Williams (Ibinabo Jack) gives Vera a useful tip off. And then one of Harry's old fraud cases begins to cross over into Vera's enquiries. Aided by DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison) and pathologist Dr Marcus Summer (Kingsley Ben-Adir), Vera discovers a web of secrets that lead her to Harry's killer. Source: Supplied
