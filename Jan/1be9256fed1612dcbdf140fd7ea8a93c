Lilongwe â€” Ghetto King Kong Fredokiss has finally released the much anticipated the music video for the song Amafila Fredo which was the theme song for the three free concerts he held under his Ghetto Ghutter Entertainment last year. The video which is featuring footage from the concerts probably becomes the only video to be shot in all the three regions of the country and also the only music video to feature thousands of participating characters, more especially the youth. In an interview with Malawi News Agency (Mana), Fredokiss said the video aims at painting a picture of what the concerts were like for those who missed the shows. "It feels great to finally release this video. This is a video which since the beginning was designed to be for the masses and for those who missed the three concerts. "As such, you will see that this is a participatory video for especially for the average kid, and is featuring a lot of people," he said. Some of the highlights in the video include his historical arrival at the Mzuzu stadium concert in a helicopter, his famous entry on stage at Masintha ground in Lilongwe whose photos went viral on social media, clips of his continues interaction with fans from the three concerts and those of his performances. According to the artist, this was a big project which demanded dedication from planning, shooting and editing. "The energy that was put into coming up with the video was just overwhelming especially in the planning stages. "On the other hand, there was a big challenge in choosing the right footage from the numerous footages that we had and to select the best was a challenge. But with hard work we at the end of the day we managed to come up with this beautiful and unique video," said Fredokiss.
