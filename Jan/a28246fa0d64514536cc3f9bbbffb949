Specifically, the Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting, Ambrose Omodion, said: "The renewed buying market as a result of positive sentiments was revealed by institutional money flow index that turned up after last Friday's trading session. This is as foreign investors continued to position in the nation's equities to balance their portfolios based on the frontier MSCI index as emerging markets remain the attraction of foreign fund managers. "This is also due to the current low stock valuations in an economy that has recovered from recession and already on the growth path as reflected in the continued positive economic data. However, we would like to reiterate that investors should go for equities with intrinsic value, especially during this season that dividend payment is approaching. "We advise investors to allow the numbers to guide their decisions, while repositioning for the rest of the year's trading activities, especially now that stock prices remain volatile amidst improving company, economic and market fundamentals. "It is time to combine fundamentals and technical tools to take decision by knowing the support and resistant level to reposition or exit any position. Market is in phases; know the cycles in order to manage your trading and investing risk."
