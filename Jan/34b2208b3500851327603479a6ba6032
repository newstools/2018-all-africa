At age 9 Khadija moved to Mogadishu where at early age started composing poems until her breakthrough early 1950s when she saw an advertise in the colonial era newspaper, Corriere Della Somalia seekimg a female singer for Radio Mogadishu. Her 1952 debut into recording songs at Radio Mogadishu triggered protest by religious scholars but her father Abdullahi Amey intervened to support his daughter and her star in entertainment begun to rise.
