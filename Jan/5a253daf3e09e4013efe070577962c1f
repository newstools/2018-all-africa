Lafia â€” The Nasarawa State House of Assembly has cautioned politicians, religious leaders and other stakeholders in the Nigeria project against inciting statements capable of bringing more confusion as a result of the crisis between farmers and herdsmen in the country, especially the new year killings in Benue State. Speaker of the state assembly, Ibrahim Abdullahi, gave the caution yesterday while reading the assembly's resolution after the majority leader of the assembly, Tanko Tunga, brought the matter during the assembly's proceeding in Lafia. Abdullahi cautioned that politicians and other stakeholders should always engage in peaceful messages rather than inciting the public with statements that could create more confusion to the society. The Speaker then called on farmers and herdsmen to co-exist peacefully in order to boost food production as he worried that "their continued feud may cause food shortages in the state and the country at large." He said: "What happened in Benue State was very sad because so many people had lost their lives and properties worth millions of naira destroyed as a result of the crisis. "This house shared the pains over the loss of lives and properties in Benue and Nasarawa States border communities. We also appreciate the federal government's efforts in tackling security challenges in the country," the speaker maintained.
