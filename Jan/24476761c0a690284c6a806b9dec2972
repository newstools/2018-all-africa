Abuja â€” Over two hundred indigenes of Benue state Thursday stormed the National Assembly Complex demanding that the Federal Government should jettison the idea of establishing colonies for cattle across the country. The protesters also condemned the new year attack by herdsmen where eight Benue indigenes were killed. Clad in black attires and wielding different placards, the protesters lamented the killings suspected to have been carried out by herdsmen. They also kicked against the idea of establishing cattle colonies across Nigeria. The protesters were predominantly the Tiv, Idoma,Igede and other ethnic nationalities in Benue. But their major grudge was the fact that President Muhammadu Buhari refused to visit Benue after the massacre. Over 88 indigenes of Benue have been killed in separate attacks within the last one month. Buhari has held different meetings with stakeholders from the state and top security officials. Recall that members of the House of Representatives Benue caucus sensing danger of this magnitude had last year November in a briefing begged the Federal Government to quickly set up mobile units to monitor red spots in Benue. The spokesman of the caucus Rep John Dyegh,APC, Benue at the briefing pleaded and threatened that if the trend continues Benue people may have to defend their territory. As at the time of filing this report a pocketful of the protesters were still seen lurking around the NASS main entry point.
