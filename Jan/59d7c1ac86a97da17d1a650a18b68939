Kenyans on social media have come up with the African version of Samantha, the high tech sex doll with womanly features which is en vogue on social media. The African version, however, is nothing like the 'real' Samantha which allows a buyer to hand-pick features such as face, hair and breast size. The dolls are programmed to remember the owner's birthday and favorite films and music. A picture shared by an online user on the popular Facebook group Kilimani Mums and Dads uncensored, showed two dolls with black skin color wearing long dresses made out of Kitenge together with a big oversized head gear. HILARIOUS COMMENTS "Samantha za huko western," the group member captioned the photo. The post received numerous hilarious comments from netizens. This is what they had to say. "samantha Wafula ako hapa," said one online user. "Hio umedanganya watu wa Western wamekula wakabeba mwili," wrote another online user. "Nani ali-introduce Samantha wa kwenu huku," asked another online user. "Western they're qute hao labda niwa hapo kwenyu," commented one online user. "mulamwa Samantha aliyepotea naropi amepatikana," added another online user. "Wapi unga kando yao?" asked one group member. "Hahahahaaa..sasa hizi kiuno iko wapi?" asked one online user.
