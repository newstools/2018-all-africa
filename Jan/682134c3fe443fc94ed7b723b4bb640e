Jos â€” Five people have been killed in attack and a counter-attack between Irigwe and Fulani youths in Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State. Sources within Bassa said the residents found Monday evening the corps of three Irigwe youths alleged to have been killed by Fulani herders, and the North Central Chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Danladi Chiroma, told Daily Trust that two Fulani youths: Musa Idris and Anas Zakariya, were equally killed around Kamarun Chawai on Tuesday by youths believed to be Irigwe. He described the renewed violent incidents in the area as political, saying, "This government and security agents are trying their best but the youths from both sides must learn to exercise restraint and not allow politicians to deceive them." A military insider told Daily Trust that the attacks were a tit for tat. "The youths from the two ethnic groups cannot claim innocence. They are the ones causing all the problems," he said Operation Safe Haven Media and Information Officer, Major Adam Umar confirmed the five deaths, saying, "The three people killed around an illegal mining site are suspected to be Irigwe youths while the other two corpses are suspected to be of Fulani youths. We are investigating the killings." The state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Tyopev Terna, said the CP Adie Undie had just ended a meeting between locals and herders from Bassa, Jos South, Riyom and Barkin Ladi LGAs and had warned them to desist from attacks and counter-attacks.
