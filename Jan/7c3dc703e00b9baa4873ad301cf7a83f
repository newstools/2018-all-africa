Mwiza Chavura's song, Rape, has received backlash for glorying rape. In the song, Chavura is announcing a plot "to let a girl get drunk on his bills with an intention of raping her for turning down his sexual advances on her".Â  The song has been banned, but still making rounds on social media platforms.
