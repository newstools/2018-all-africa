Musician Akothee has rattled her fans after posting a picture of herself wearing a laced thigh-high jumpsuit that leaves little to the imagination. The singer, who recently confessed to be dating her manager Nelly Oaks, posed alongside two people she identifies as her dance instructors. "Starting my dance classes with the best ballet guru, looking brighter, yesterday was a blast," wrote Akothee. Most of her fans expressed disappointment at the revealing attire. 'DISTURBING PICTURE' "What are you wearing? Doesn't look good... you should wear this indoors for NellyOaks. Very disturbing picture," said one_rebelbelle. "Nguo zingine tuachie tu kim kardashian u always dress nicely hii ukweli usemwe it's a no no something is just wrong," wrote hambasa2014. "You seriously need a dresser," added kimutai_m. "Mother of 5 dressing like this, watchu teaching your daughters?" asked dorah_diva. "We all admire your relentless energy & vibes but leo enyewe umetulet down," commented yunasi2015. "And which dance class have you seen people dress like this? and read the caption properly and understand before commenting, she said this pic is from yesterday but she is starting her dance classes today," said one_rebelbelle. 👉👉 starting my dance classes with the best ballet guru @👉👉 @juli_juli_1 2018 looking brighter, yesterday was a blast 😍😍 @garodaresortkenya A post shared by Akothee Kenya (@akotheekenya) on Jan 21, 2018 at 10:50pm PST Others were of a different view.
