The chat between the designer and the bride After receiving backlash on social media, the designer issued a statement of apology and blamed her lack of delivery on logistic issues. Mercy's statement reads thus, "I have followed events as they unfold following a particular dress I wore for a photoshoot. First, I must say that I sincerely sympathise with the bride as this situation is painful, unfortunate and regrettably avoidable. I hired and paid Seun @styledbyseun for the photoshoot as a stylist and got four dresses for the shoot. "Seun and I were unaware that one of the dresses was meant for someone else. I am embarrassed that the designer was not professional enough in handling events leading to this moment. "It is also painful that a bride is made to go through what the bride has been made to go through. I have reached out to both the stylist and designer (whom I have never met nor HIRED directly) to express my displeasure. "I have instructed my lawyer to look into this and see how best to approach this from a legal point of view without festering an already open wound. Thanks."
