Yemi Alade is one of Africa's most accomplished Female Singers this decade. In 2017, she made history by being the only top African act to release an album and EP in the same year. The songstress is currently enjoying the success of her latest banger "Go Down" as she's about to embark on her European tour starting this April. Yemi is releasing "Go Down" in East Africa, as a continuation of the mega presence and space she commands in the region. In 2018, the songstress is planning to work with more top East African artistes. Her latest Swahili songs were "Nakupenda" featuring Nyashinski and a feature on "911" with Krizbeatz and Tanzanian artiste Harmonize is a testament to that. Produced by Philkeyz off Yemi's deluxe edition of her third studio album "Black Magic" set for release in 2018: "Go Down" has a groovy and 90s R&B feel --making it one of Yemi's most unique new classics. The music video boasts colorful visuals and the work of leading cinematographer Paul Gambit.
