Machakos â€” Machakos County will get Sh1 billion from the World Bank to support the Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Project. This includes improving water and soil management and promoting sustainable community-driven rangeland management. This was disclosed by World Bank Lead Agriculture Economist, Dr. Ladisy Komba Chengula when he paid a courtesy call on Machakos Governor Dr. Alfred Mutua in his office. Mutua met the World Bank group to discuss special funding for the county's agriculture program. "We will also look into improving access to quality livestock services, supporting the generation and dissemination of agricultural technologies, innovations and management practices," Dr. Chengula said. The WB will also assist Machakos in enhancing access to quality agro-weather, climate, advisory and market information services among farmers for improved decision making. Mutua said part of the funding will be utilized to undertake a major irrigation project through a dam along the Athi River. "Agriculture is key in my development manifesto under the Maendeleo Chap Chap banner and this assistance could not have come at a better time," said Mutua who was accompanied by his Agriculture and Co-operative Minister Ruth Mutua. He added that his government had also embarked on a program to boost food production by providing free seeds and ploughing services over the years. He reiterated his call to farmers to plant drought-resistant crops as a result of the erratic rainfall in the county. "My government is in the process of ensuring all sub-locations in the county will have at least two boreholes to ensure water availability for both domestic use and irrigation," Mutua said.
