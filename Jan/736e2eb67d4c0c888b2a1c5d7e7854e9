Department of Labour implores employers to file 2017 employment equity reports All employers will have until next Monday (15 January 2015) to file their employment equity (EE) online reports in line with legislation. The 2017 EE Online and Manual reporting season opened on 1 September 2017. The manual reporting submissions closed on 01 October 2017. The reporting season was preceded by a series of national road shows held by the Department of Labour's EE Directorate, in which the Department sought to encourage and create awareness on compliance with the Employment Equity Act, publicise and help prepare the employers with the requirements needed to be used when submitting their online 2017 EE reports to the Department. Special emphasis during the workshops was placed on the following: To publicise the Amended Code of Good Practice on the Preparation and Implementation of the EE plans, To encourage employers to submit EE reports online, To publicise the 17th CEE Annual Report and the 2016 EE Public Register, and To represent current CCMA cases on Employment Equity Act. The Employment Act has the following objectives: promoting equal opportunity and fair treatment in employment through the elimination of unfair discrimination; and implementing affirmative action measures to redress the disadvantages in employment experienced by designated groups, to ensure their equitable representation in all occupational levels in the workforce.
