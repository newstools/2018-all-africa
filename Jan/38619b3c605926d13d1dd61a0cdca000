Ado Ekiti â€” Ekiti state Governor, Ayodele Fayose, at the weekend said the activities of killer Fulani herders are denting the names of the President Muhammadu Buhari and other Fulani leaders who mean well for the country. Fayose who was furious about the recent killing of a Tiv pregnant woman in Orin Ekiti by people suspected to be Fulani herders, vowed that he would hold the Serikin Fulani in the state, Muhammed Abashe, responsible for any further attack in the state. The governor said Abashe had failed in providing leadership by not stopping his kinsmen from destroying farms and attacking residents. Baring his mind at a peace meeting with the Fulani herders under the aegis of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, farmers, local hunters, security agencies and representatives of the Tiv community in Ado Ekiti, the governor said he would not stand by and watch anybody taking the lives of innocent people in the state. He said "if you (Fulani herders) still want to stay among us, you must ensure that none of our people's farms is destroyed by herdsmen any longer. None of our people must be killed by your men; either they are strangers or those herdsmen living among us. If any killing or destruction of farms of our people occurs again in the area, I will ensure that I use the law to fight you their leaders on it. This is the last warning I am giving you" he said.
