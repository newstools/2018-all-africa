The United Nations Mission in the troubled Central African Republic, known by its French acronym, MINUSCA, has given armed groups in the north of the country 48 hours to clear out. The Mission wants to clear a 50 kilometre perimeter around the town allowing displaced persons to return. Over the last three weeks, some 60,000 people - mostly women - left everything behind to escape clashes between the armed groups Justice Riot (RJ) and the National Movement for the Liberation of the Central African Republic (MNLC).
