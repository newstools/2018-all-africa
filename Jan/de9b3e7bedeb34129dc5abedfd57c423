ZAMBIA has recorded a reduction by 50 per cent in new cholera cases, according to a trend analysis conducted in the last seven days. Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya has attributed the development to the various interventions to curb cholera by the Government and various stakeholders. Dr Chilufya said in the last 24 hours, only 26 children and 59 adults were taken to the cholera centre. "I am happy to announce that out of the 2,840 cases recorded, only 166 were admitted to cholera treatment units and 132 at Heroes cholera centre as the rest were successfully treated and discharged," Dr Chilufya said. He said the cumulative death toll in Lusaka was 64 with three community deaths from Matero, Kanyama and Chipata one each in the last 24 hours.
