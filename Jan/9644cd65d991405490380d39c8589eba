Rehabilitation of the plant was financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB) at a cost of US$8.6 million. The plant will augment the supply of water to Monrovia and its environs with 8 to 16 million gallons per day. The President said at the dedication that prior to the extensive rehabilitation work, every facet of the water facility was affected by structural damage which caused mud to consume the water filters meant to clean and purify the water before channeling it to consumers. There are two important things about social services that give human beings satisfaction, namely light and water which are essential, said the President. She expressed delight that her administration successfully embarked on the improvement of the plant which was destroyed during the civil war. She called on residents of the community to protect the plant and be proud of what their government and partners have done. President Sirleaf commended the LWSC Managing Director, Hun-Bu Tulay, chairman of the Board, Dr. Kimmie Weeks, partners, and workers for committing themselves to improving the facility in an effort to increase the supply of pipe-borne water to the public. The LWSC MD said with the rehabilitation and improvement of the water facility, no Liberian in urban areas will die due to the lack of clean water because the management has done everything to reach them with pipe borne water.
