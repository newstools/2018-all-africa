Enugu â€” The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, on on Monday dismissed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo's 10-man committee on the Fulani herdsmen/farmers' clash as a wrong diagnosis and panacea to a deadly ailment. The organisation's President General, Chief Nnia Nwodo, in a statement by his Media Adviser, Emeka Atama, insisted that before coming up with the idea of a committee, those who unleashed mayhem on hapless Benue State indigenes should first be arrested and made to face the full weight of the law. Nwodo wondered how the federal government could set up a committee to reconcile murderers with the murdered in a sane clime. He said the pronouncements by the leadership of Miyetti Allah were evidence that they were culpable for the carnage across the country and wondered why they were not arrested and prosecuted instead of setting up a committee. He noted that Nigerians had expected that invaders who violated a law enacted by a state in the country should face prosecution instead of the condescending and patronising stance of the federal government. The federal government in refusing to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of the heinous crimes in the country, he said, was suggestive of its complicity and bias on the matter. He further said the setting up of the committee was a violation of the law courts "where such cases of murder should rightly be decided instead of turning them into mere communal clashes which further encourages the Fulani herdsmen."
