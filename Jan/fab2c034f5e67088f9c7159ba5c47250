Gaborone â€” With Ndingo Johwa having brought Sekalaka to the fore with his music, one Marapong lad has also released an album in Kalanga and he delivers his tunes with a unique genre of music called zouk that is common in mostly Eastern and Central Africa. Chakalisa Mongwa has released a six-track album in Kalanga and its titled Buzwani Bakadzi. Chakalisa said in an interview that all the songs on the album were written and composed by him. "I have always loved music more especially soul and afro jazz and my musical inspiration comes from Ndingo Johwa, Felix Wazekwa and Orchestra Super Mazembe," said the young lad from Marapong. He indicated that he loved the way Ndingo Johwa came up with his lyrics and how he made it versatile and unique when it was not commonly being used on mainstream music. "My type of music is called zouk and is a mixture of afro jazz and rhumba with a little bit of salsa and I brought it to Botswana because I believe that music is a universal language and with our own beats it can be great," he said. Chakalisa's music is soothing and can be listened to on a lazy Sunday afternoon. From the first track to the last, you can hear what he says and unlike some albums where the beat overpowers the lyrics, Buzwani Bakadzi has been done properly and it is a good listen. He indicated that the album was produced at Sweet Melodies Records in Gaborone West and it could be found around Gaborone in shops. With this being his debut album, Chakalisa said he hoped Batswana could at least give it a shot before they shut doors in his face. "People should listen to this album and they will not be disappointed," he said, adding that local artistes should be given a chance before they were dismissed. One can only hope that the young lad from Marapong would grow and make more music for those that love it. Source : BOPA
