Maiduguri â€” The Nigerian Army has alerted residents and communities to be weary of several wounded and fleeing Boko Haram terrorists in Borno State. This is coming as troops of Operation Lafiya Dole dealt a devastating blow to the terrorists, resulting in several casualties during Operation Deep Punch II in Sambisa Forest. The ongoing military operation was to route the remaining Boko Haram terrorists from their various hideouts, including Camp Zairo, which the Army captured on December 23, 2016. Army spokesman, Brig-Gen Sani Usman, disclosed this yesterday in a statement in Maiduguri. He said the fleeing terrorists would want to take cover and begin to infiltrate isolated places and communities on the fringes of Sambisa Forest in Borno, Adamawa and Gombe states in the Northeast region. He advised that residents, communities and peace loving members of the society should be on the alert and look out for escaping Boko Haram terrorists in their midst. "You should promptly report any observed strange movements and suspicious persons in your respective communities or settlements to the military and other security agencies. "The fleeing insurgents may take cover in places of worship and weddings, markets and other places of public gatherings," he added. Usman pointed out that the defeated Boko Haram terrorists, in their desperation to remain relevant, might further resort to employing suicide bombers to inflict more pain and terror on innocent and unsuspecting Nigerians. "Communities located on the fringes of Sambisa Forest are also enjoined to put in place security measures for reporting incidences to help the military and security agencies respond promptly," he stressed.
