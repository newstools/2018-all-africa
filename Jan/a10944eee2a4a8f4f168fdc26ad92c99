There was drama at Redeemed Gospel Church in Jericho on Sunday when worshippers heckled Starehe Member of Parliament, Charles Njagua aka Jaguar after the church service. The first time MP had accompanied Deputy President William Ruto and Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to the church in consecration service of Rev Felix Kavoi and ordination of Pastor Anne Ndeti . But shortly after the service, some worshippers started booing the MP, and calling him 'kigeugeu' (a person without a clear stance) for his recent spat with some Nairobi politicians. 'KIGEUGEU' "Huyo Kigeugeu, huyo kigeugeu," some worshippers were heard chanting. Last week Jaguar went to court to sue the county government for kicking out boda boda operators from Nairobi's Central Business District. Apparently, this is what some of the worshippers were unhappy about, given that both Jaguar and Sonko belong to the Jubilee party. Kigeugeu is one of Jaguar's hit songs. During the Jubilee Party nominations before the August 8 general election, Jaguar was denied the party ticket and it took intervention of senior party officials, including Sonko, for him to get the party ticket.
