Maiduguri â€” Nigerian troops on Thursday rescued a girl who was part of over 270 schoolgirls that were kidnapped by the Boko Haram sect north-east of the country in 2014. The girl has been identified as Salomi Pagu, rescued in Pulka in the Borno State alongside a child said to be hers and another young girl, Jamila Adams, aged 14. Pagui is published on serial 86 of the online list of abducted Chibok girls. Col Onyema Nwachukwu, the Deputy Director Public Relations of the Operation Lafiya Dole (Peace by Force), said the rescued minors were in the safe custody of troops and receiving medical attention. The Boko Haram kidnapped 276 female students from the Chibok government secondary school on the night of April 14-15, 2014. More than 50 girls escaped a few months following the abduction in the Borno State. Over 100 more have been released, most recently in May 2017, after negotiations between government and the extremists.
