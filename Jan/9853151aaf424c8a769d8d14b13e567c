President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to pay N100million to families of those butcherd by herdsmen in Benue, Taraba and other places. Chieftain of All Progressives Congress, APC, and a presidential aspirant of the party, Chief Charles Udeogaranya made the appeal yesterday in Lagos during a chat with Vanguard. He said: "While I sympathize with families and states governments which the herdsmen have terrorized in Nigeria, I urge President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently pay a sum of N100 million on every life lost to the families of the deceased and bring to a stop, these killings in Nigeria. "Our constitution has made it clear that security and welfare of Nigerians shall be the primary responsibility of government but it is unfortunate that herdsmen are on killing spree under the watchful eyes of the Commander- in-Chief of the Armed Forces and one who swore to uphold the constitution and defend the right to life of citizens. "If I'm successful in my quest to lead Nigeria , there shall be no open heavens for herdsmen. Their menace shall cease."
