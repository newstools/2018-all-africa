Maiduguri â€” More than 50 women and girls forcefully abducted by Boko Haram insurgents have been reunited with their parents in Borno State. Executive Director Herwa Community Development Initiatives, Dr. Mohammed Hassan, disclosed this in a chat with Daily Trust in Maiduguri yesterday, saying that just last week two women were united with their parents after six years of abduction. He said the CDI partners with International Alert to reunite especially women and girls abducted by arms groups in seven LGAs of Borno State. "More than 50 cases have been resolved in Dikwa, Bama, Mafa and other LGAs. It was tears of joy as Aisha a survivor from Bama Science Secondary School IDPs camp, was united by Herwa CDI international Alert project with both parents after years of separation. "Aisha and Iza both arrived at Dalori 1 IDPs camp last Saturday with a permit from Bama camp and accompanied to Dalori by a SEMA staff. Onlookers at the camp could not help but to join the father and daughter to shed some more tears of joy," Dr. Mohammed said. Dr. Mohammed appealed to philanthropists to donate some clothing and other items to the returnees. "Aishat, 27, has six children. The husband is missing. As she is back she needs help," he said.
