Addis Ababa â€” THE .africa flag has returned to its home at the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, after an epic journey across a number of African countries. An expedition team comprising a cross-section of nationalities from AU member states has returned the flag after the tour climaxed with a successful summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa at about 4,900 metres (16,100 ft). Well-known mountaineer and .africa expedition team leader, Deshun Deysel, led the .africa team's arduous trek. The flag's journey began when it was officially handed over to the .africa team in the Nelson Mandela Plenary Hall at the AU Headquarters. "Communicating .africa's potential to uplift Africa economically has been a major objective of our pan-African journey and I believe we achieved this goal," said Lucky Masilela, Chief Executive Officer of the Registry Africa). He is now a successful Mount Kilimanjaro summiteer. Masilela said the .africa generic top-level domain could help Africa leapfrog its way to the pinnacle of information and communication technology achievement. The World Economic Forum and the African Development Bank have highlighted Africa's concerted effort to invest in ICT-related infrastructure and trends like the Internet of Things. "The recent launch of the .africa gTLD is clearly spot-on in this regard," Masilela said.
