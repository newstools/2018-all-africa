Zaria â€” The Ambassador of Northern Ireland, Sean Hoy, yesterday said Nigeria can learn from the experiences of his country in addressing the myriad of crises facing her. Hoy made this known at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria while speaking as a keynote address presenter in a lecture tagged 'Road to Peace: Lessons from the Northern Ireland Peace Process' organised by Ireland Embassy in collaboration with Like-Minds, a Non-Governmental Organisation. He said Ireland used dialogue to address her four decades old conflicts where people were made to lay down their arms and embrace one another. "What many considered impossible may be possible when it comes to search for lasting peace. Peace building is a slow work; it is hard; it takes time; it fails; it restarts and it is ever cinematic," he said. The ABU Vice Chancellor, Professor Ibrahim Garba, represented by DVC Administration, Professor Kabir Bala, said the varsity would continue to be the centre of solutions to socio-economic problems through the provision of scientific and qualitative research findings.
