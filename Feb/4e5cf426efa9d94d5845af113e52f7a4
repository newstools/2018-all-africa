A radio journalist has admitted to contemplating suicide days after losing his job at a vernacular radio station. In a worrying Facebook post, sacked Kameme FM presenter Moses Kanyira says he would have already taken his life 'if not for God.' He wrote: "Am passing through the most trying period in my life. If it is not my God, this can amount to commit(ing) suicide." The message elicited mixed reactions from his friends on Facebook. Sarah Njeri wrote: "May the peace of our Lord Jesus be with you. Put your hope in the Lord. He will guide you through na usijinyonge (dont hang yourself), kufutwa kazi si mwisho wa maisha (Getting sacked isnt the end of the world). God is leading you to higher heights. Ngugi de Hero added: "No need ufikirie hivyo (do not think like that) Mimi ni fan wa Kameme na wewe (I am also a fan of Kameme FM). Naomba tu Mungu afanye maajabu urudi Kameme (I pray God to work his miracle and return you to your job). We need you there." Nairobi News understands Kanyira recently lost his job at the popular vernacular station in circumstances that are yet to be made public. This development, sources explain, has left him stressed after accruing debts due to to a lack of consistent source of income. Kanyira had worked at the station for over seven years. He is said to be nursing a sick parent who requires constant care, treatment and medication.
