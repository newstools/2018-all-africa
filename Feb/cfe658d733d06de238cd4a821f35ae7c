President Cyril Ramaphosa has extended his sincere condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Tourism, Honourable Beatrice Thembekile Ngcobo, who passed away on Sunday 18 February 2018, at the age of 74. Ms Ngcobo, who held an MA Social Sciences and a Diploma in Advanced Nursing Education (University of KwaZulu-Natal), was a respected activist across various sectors, including for Disabled People South Africa. She died after a short illness. President Ramaphosa said Ms Ngcobo's passing away represented a great loss to Parliament and the tourism sector at a time when government is preparing to work with all role players in the industry to aggressively increase the number of visitors to South Africa and employment in the sector. President Ramaphosa said Ms Ngcobo's resolute and collaborative leadership with which Ms Ngcobo had guided the portfolio committee and the tourism sector at large was itself a manifestation of the positive nation brand which South Africa presented to the world with integrity and innovation. "The ultimate honour we can pay to this great ambassador for tourism to South Africa and within South Africa is to sustain the gains and strides tourism we witnessed during Ms Ngcobo's tenure at the helm of the portfolio committee. Her invaluable contribution - and especially her passion for the wellbeing of travelers to and in our country - will be sorely missed," said President Ramaphosa. Issued by: The Presidency
