Even after he denied to be having an affair with singer Avril, who is currently rumoured to be pregnant, video director Jibril Blessing (popularly known as J Blessing) has continued to be heavily linked to the sexy lass. The latest reports claim that he has gifted her with a luxurious car. A few weeks ago, while appearing on a TV interview, J Blessing refuted claims that he is currently dating Avril. He even denied being the man responsible for the singer's pregnancy. However, word in the streets has it that the two are madly in love, but are trying so hard to keep it a secret. The latest reports claim that the shy video director has decided to give Avril his BMW 3 series, worth approximately Ksh3.5 million, to ease her travel around the city. Interestingly, the rumour about the two dating broke late last year after Avril was spotted driving the same car. Avril and J Blessing are said to have started seeing each other sometime after their previous relationships ended. J Blessing was married to Chantelle until mid-last year when they parted ways, whereas Avril ended her two-year engagement to South African fianc√© Muga in July 2016.
