A few hours ago, we brought you information that popular Nigerian comedienne, Emmanuella, has landed a Hollywood Disney role. In reaction to this, the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, took to social media platform, Twitter, to congratulate her and her acting group, Mark Angel Comedy. He also invited them to the Senate to "discuss how we can develop the potential of our young talents in the creative industry". See the tweet below: Congratulations Emmanuella! Make sure you make them laugh over there. Your story is an inspiration. Come by the @NGRSenate sometime, let's discuss how we can develop the potential of our young talents in the creative industry. cc: @markangelcomedyhttps://t.co/fvyzajeJYE -- Bukola Saraki (@bukolasaraki) February 18, 2018
