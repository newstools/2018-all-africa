Ghanaian chief Yeboah Kenyase has expressed his appreciation at the sculptures exhibited at Dominic Studios in Greendale saying such artworks call for cultural exchange between Ghana and Zimbabwe. The 38-year-old chief who comes from one of the largest royalties in Africa under King Otumfuo Osei Tutu of the Asante Empire, said this after a familiarisation tour of Dominic Studios, run by renowned sculptor Dominic Benhura. Chief Kenyase who is also the organiser of the Africa Hip-Hop Awards said there was a symbiotic relationship between music and sculpture. "I am here to see how we can set up a branch in Zimbabwe for the Africa Hip-Hop Awards. "The good thing is you already have Zim Hip-Hop awards which are up and running, so we are going to be working with the team here. "However, I also wanted to familiarize myself with other art forms here with the hope of bringing together sculpture and music. "I am pleased with what Benhura is doing. "This is one of the amazing places I have seen where it is not only space for renowned sculptures but young artists as well," Chief Kenyase said. Turning to music, Chief Kenyase said some of the Zimbabwean artists lacked the much needed exposure and the Africa Hip Hop Awards would provide the bigger platform for local and continental artists. "There is so much talent in Zimbabwe but talent alone is not enough. You need exposure and the Africa Hip-Hop Awards are a bigger platform," he said. Benhura reiterated that it was humbling to host some of Africa's high ranking royalty members at the studios in the likes of Chief Kenyase. He said plans were afoot to host group exhibitions in both Zimbabwe and Ghana. Besides organising the AHHA through his company Platinum Events Management, Chief Kenyase also runs the Miss Zambia beauty pageant and Uganda Music Awards.
