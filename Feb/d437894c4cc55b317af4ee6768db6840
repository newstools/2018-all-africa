Lokoja â€” A 45-year-old man has been killed by the Fulani herdsmen after invading his farmland and destroying other farm produce in Ankpa Local Government Areal of Kogi State. THISDAY reliably gathered yesterday that the incident occurred on Monday evening at Uferance Emekuku. According to a source, the man was farming in his farm when the said herdsmen allegedly led their cows to his farm. The source said: "The man went to his farm to harvest his cassavas when the Fulani herdsmen attacked and killed him in the evening on Monday. "He left home as early as 6a.m. to harvest some cassava in his farm. When it was getting late, we didn't see him so we decided to go and look for him only to discover he has been killed by the Fulani herdsmen. "We saw traces of cow steps, and some of the cassava that were harvested by him was eaten by the cows and destroyed other cassava that are yet to be harvested." The state Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, had already surrendered 15,000 acres of land in Kogi central senatorial of the state to the Fulani herdsmen as cattle colony to attract Fulani herdsmen to the state. Meanwhile when THISDAY called on the state Police Command Public Relations Office, Mr. William Ayah, he said the Divisional Police Officer in Ankpa was yet to brief the command on the incident.
