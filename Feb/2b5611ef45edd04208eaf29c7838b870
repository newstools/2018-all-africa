Kisumu city had rolled out the red carpet for Lupita Nyong'o to grace the premiere of her latest movie "Black Panther", but she has instead opted to go to South Africa. Lupita has been globe-trotting to promote the movie, with South Africa set to be her next stop. The movie officially premieres on Friday worldwide. Kisumu city, where her father Anyang Nyong'o is governor, had spared no costs in anticipation of Lupita's arrival on February 13. Speaking to Nairobi News, Imax marketing manager Flora Njagi said they chose to stage the movie's premiere in Kisumu because Lupita was "a girl from that soil". Lupita plays Nakia, a Wakanda spy and former flame of new king T'Challa, who is often sent on missions around the world. Her co-star Danai Gurira, who plays the proud general Okoye, shared a picture on social media on the two flying to South Africa. En route to South Africa!!!

"She couldn't be here in the flesh, but for her fans, Lupita's presence on the movie poster, on display at the premiere next to the red carpet in Nairobi and Kisumu was enough for us added," said Ms Njaigi.
