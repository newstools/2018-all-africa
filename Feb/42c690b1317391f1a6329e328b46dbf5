President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Wednesday acknowledged superstar Oliver Mutukudzi and said the musician was one of the country's ambassadors to the international world. The local, regional and international award winning musician had been invited to provide entertainment at the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) railway wagons reception ceremony which was held at the parastatal's premises in Bulawayo. The event was graced by President Mnangagwa. Acknowledging Tuku's presence before reading his speech, President Mnangagwa said the iconic musician was one of the country's ambassadors "I want to recognize our music icon Oliver Mutukudzi who is here with us," said President Mnangagwa inviting him to the podium. "May you please come here so that everyone here sees that you are here," he said before shaking hands with the musician who humbly accepted the acknowledgement. Tuku, after the official statements from various stakeholders who attended the colourful event, ignited the City of Kings when he performed the song Right Direction. The track is one of his old classics and talks about boarding a train. The song also compares the difference between a person who is traveling in the first class and the one in the economy class but in the same train saying that the two get to their destinations the same time despite the different classes they would have travelled in. Tuku performed for over an hour and left thousands of Bulawayo residents who had come to witness the new wagons reception wanting for more.
