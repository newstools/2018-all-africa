Kisumu County occupied an enviable position in history by hosting the screening of the Black Panther, a movie Lupita Nyong'o has starred in. Imax Cinema at Nakumatt Mega City was selected to host this movie, which has in the last few weeks been talk of town. Actress Lupita is the daughter of Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o. Kisumu County Executive in charge of Tourism Achie Ojany Olai told reporters that she expected the movie screening to go on as planned even though she confirmed the Oscar-winning star will not attend. Nevertheless, the official argued the occasion itself will help market the county as a possible destination for tourists and film makers given the enthusiasm among locals and talent it has shown. "The movie might be in Kisumu but will be a national and international affair," Ms Olai said. Imax Cinema was expected to open its doors to the public at 6pm for the red carpet event that is expected to run for a total of 45 minutes before the official screening at 7pm. The action-packed film that runs for 140 minutes is an invite-only movie that will in turn show Africa's beauty and traditions. The movie is set in African regalia which sets the theme for the event. Purple, red, green, black and gold are the mouth-watering colours that are expected to light up the event. Kisumu deputy governor Mathews Owili was expected to grace the event.
