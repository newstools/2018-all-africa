Actress Lupita Nyong'o and actor Michael B. Jordan, two Black Panther stars, made a bet which has resulted in the latter doing on demand push-ups. Fans have noticed that Lupita has been toying with her co-star on their press tour, continually demanding for the push-ups. The two who play Erik Killmonger and Nakia in Black Panther respectively, have not revealed what the bet was other than Jordan lost it. The actor recently had to pay the price when the Black Panther cast came together back stage at The View, with his first of three owed push-ups being caught on camera for the world to enjoy. Even better, though, is that she's been choosing the most inopportune times to demand them, and she's even started documenting them on social media, too. Her most recent video is even better, though, ambushing him while he was getting ready in the green room of The View. "How many would you like," he asks. "I wanna do one now, and we'll see about the rest," she tells him. @michaelbjordan, losing with a smile. On call push-ups!!!
