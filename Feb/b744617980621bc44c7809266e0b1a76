Detectives from Entebbe main police station have visited the bar where Ugandan singer Moses Ssekibogo alias Mowzey Radio was allegedly beaten before he succumbed to head injuries at Case Hospital last week. Police detectives on Tuesday took suspects to De Bar to reconstruct the scene of the deceased singer's brawl that led to his head injuries. George Egessa, the manager of De Bar, a popular hangout in Entebbe town that has since been closed by Entebbe Municipal authorities was one of the suspects taken to the scene. Police visit comes barely a day after they said they had arrested the prime suspect, Godfrey Wamala alias Troy who allegedly beat the singer causing his death. Wamala was arrested at Kyengera in Wakiso District on Sunday night after a tip off by a team led by Katwe Division Police commander, Frantile Lwamusaayi. Upon arrest, Wamala was taken to Katwe Police Station where he recorded a statement before he was transferred to Entebbe Police Station where the offence was committed. Police said he would be taken to court to answer murder charges. Radio was beaten into coma at De Bar on the night of January 22. He died at Case Hospital where he had been admitted on February 1 and he was buried on February 3 at Nakawuku in Wakiso District.
