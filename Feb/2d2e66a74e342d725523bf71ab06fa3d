The Nigerian Army has placed N3 million cash reward for credible information that leads to the arrest of Abubakar Shekau, the fugitive factional leader of the Boko Haram. A statement by the Director Army Public Relations Brigadier General Sani Kukasheka Usman, said anyone with such credible information can either contact the Military Command and Control Centre, Operation LAFIYA DOLE, any military location, security agencies or call the Nigerian Army Information and Call Centre 193. It would be recalled that the Nigerian Army had within the week revealed that the Shekau was on the run dressed as a woman wearing either a black or blue hijab. General Usman said the Shekau as a means to avoid detection alternates between a blue or black coloured hijab. He said that Shekau from reliable information from insurgents that surrendered was last seen in a black Hijab. He urged all the remaining Boko Haram members to come out from hiding and lay down their arms so that they may be treated humanely.
