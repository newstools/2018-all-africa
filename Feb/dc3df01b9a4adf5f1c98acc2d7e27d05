Valentine's Day is likely to be the most dreaded day by a section of men. This largely because of the cost that comes with making the women in their lives happy. Women always expect romantic gestures from their partners - gifts, flowers and the sorts - which tends to put pressure on men. But with Valentine's being a one-day affair, here are a few 'creative' excuses to slip away from the celebrations. 1. I will be working honey. 2. I do not celebrate Valentine'S because it's vanity. 3. Babe my ATM card has stuck inside the machine, I have no money. 4. Valentine's is overrated. 5. Let's keep our relationship simple. 6. It's just a day for corporates to make money. 7. I will be travelling for business. 8. We do not need just a day to celebrate our love, we do it every day. 9. Valentine'S will not buy food for our home. 10. I do not even celebrate my birthday.
