Namibia got their first win, while Canada made it three wins out of three in the ICC World Cricket League Division 2 on Sunday. Canada remained in pole position to qualify for the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier by beating Kenya by 59 runs, while Namibia beat Oman by two wickets in a last over thriller, and Nepal defeated the UAE by four wickets. Namibia v Oman Namibia defeated Oman with two balls to spare as the hosts secured their first victory of the tournament. Oman who batted first relied on Jatinder Singh (29), Mohammed Nadeem (26) and Jay Odedra (26) to give the team a defendable total. It was an all-round bowling unit performance from Namibia with Sarel Burger (2-24), JJ Smit (2-43), Craig Williams (2-29) and Jan Frylinck (2-16) chipping in with two wickets apiece and restricting Oman to 165 runs in 48.5 overs. The innings of Gerhard Erasmus (63*, 108b, 6x4) led Namibia to a narrow victory with two balls remaining. Lohan Louwrens (31) and Sarel Burger (32) added important runs, but it was Erasmus' innings which took Namibia over the line. Even Oman's Bilal Khan five for 33 runs couldn't stop the hosts who achieved their first win of the tournament by two wickets. Canada v Kenya In a low-scoring match at WAP, Canada secured a 100% record for the tournament defending 186 runs. Ruvindra Gunasekera (83, 99b, 6x4, 4x6) was the stand out performer for the Canadian side, as Nitish Kumar and Saad Bin Zafar not out chipped in with 23 runs apiece. The Kenyan bowlers would have been pleased with their performance restricting Canada to a relatively low total as Nelson Odhiambo and Rakep Patel took two wickets each. Kenya's reply didn't get off to the best start losing the early wicket of Irfan Karim, but the African side got back on track and looked comfortable on 48 for one. Canada's Saad Bin Zafar (3-30) and N Dhaliwal (3-15) class soon showed as a flurry of wickets fell, with Kenya's Rakep Patel the top scorer with 32 runs. Kenya were all out for 127 runs in 39.1 overs, handing victory to Canada by 59 runs. Nepal v UAE The Nepalese bowlers handed victory to the Asian team and notched up their second win of the tournament after bowling out the UAE for 114 runs. Sompal Kami (4-30) and Sandeep Lamicchane (3-30) ripped through the UAE battling line up with only Shaiman Anwar (30) scoring contributing. Nepal Captain Paras Khadka's (51, 48b, 2x4, 5x6) led the team to victory, as the UAE put in a decent bowling effort taking six Nepal wickets. Mohammed Naveed and Amir Hayat took two wickets apiece, but Rohit Paudel (12*) and Sompal Kami (10*) saw Nepal home with a four wicket victory. - icc-cricket.com Scores in brief Namibia beat Oman by 2 wickets at Wanderers Oman 165 all out, 48.5 overs (Jatinder Singh 29, Jay Odedra 26; Jan Frylinck 2-16) Namibia 166 for 8, 49.4 overs (Gerhard Erasmus 63*, Lohan Louwrens 31; Bilal Khan 5-33) Canada beat Kenya by 59 runs at WAP Canada 186 all out, 49.2 overs (R Gunasekera 83, R Patel 2-33) Kenya 127 all out, 39.1 overs (R Patel 32, A Obanda 22; N Dhaliwal 3-15) Nepal beat UAE by 4 wickets at Trustco UNITED (reduced to a 34 over match due to a wet outfield) UAE 114 all out, 31 overs (Shaiman Anwar 30, Adnan Mufti 18; Sompal Kami 4-30) Nepal 115 for 6, 28.5 overs (Paras Khadka 51; Mohammad Naveed 2-17)
