The U.S. has reportedly extended sanctions, with a possible review after elections in July this year. The EU and the U.S.imposed sanctions in 2000, after they accused former president Robert Mugabe of trampling on human rights, rigging elections and the repression of press freedom - accusations that the former leader denied. In his turn, President Emmerson Mnangagwa who sees himself as a political reformer, says he will allow international election observers to monitor elections, and accept the results if he loses.
