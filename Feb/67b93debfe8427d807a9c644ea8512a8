An American resident, Chaz Gormley, has created a petition on change.org requesting that the "Walt Disney" company donate 25% of the profits to communities. He wrote, "Surely, more than just black people will be heading to the movies on February 16th to indulge in another piece of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, however, Marvel Studios hasn't pulled out all the stops to get everyone else to come to the theaters - they've blatantly targeted the black community, because they want the one thing the black community has to offer in abundance - black dollars". "You have the ability to not only be entertained, but to leave the theater in February knowing that a portion of your money will be coming back into your community. To not only go see a film about a fictitious country in Africa with advanced technology, but the opportunity to invest in programs which focus on the fields - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - that make such advancements possible, in real life". As at the time of writing, 2,600 people have signed the petition.
