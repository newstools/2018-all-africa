COMPANIES in the continent's cyberspace have pledged commitment to the safe and responsible use of the internet. The pledge coincides with the marking of the Safer Internet Day (SID), held annually on February 6. This year, the event has been held under the connected theme, "Create, Connect and Share Respect: A Better Internet Starts with You." Facebook announced a number of partnerships across Africa with over 20 non-governmental organisations and government agencies - with the aim of raising awareness of emerging online issues and helping to explore ways to make the internet safer for all. Partnerships were sealed with organisations in Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa. Akua Gyekye, Public Policy Manager Facebook, Africa, said with this year's growing partnerships across the continent, the company further demonstrated ongoing commitment to supporting organisations that raise awareness on these important issues. In Kenya, Safaricom hosted the SID to advocate for the responsible use of the internet at an event held at the Michael Joseph Centre. Steve Chege, Director Corporate Affairs, said access to reliable and convenient internet had become a basic need for many Kenyans, therefore data had become an important revenue stream for the firm. "But we are also aware of emerging online issues that affect our young ones such as online bullying and that is why SID is important to us," Chege said. Over the years, SID has become a landmark event in the online safety calendar. It started as an initiative of the European Union Safe Borders project in 2004 and has today grown to be celebrated in some 130 countries. - CAJ News
