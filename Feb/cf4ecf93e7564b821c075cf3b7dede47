Osogbo â€” The Ooni of Ife, Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, has said that survival of the African people rests heavily on the sustainability of the traditional culture saying government and the people must collectively utilise the culture as a way to greatly record productive economic advancement. Ooni Ogunwusi, who is the spiritual leader of the Yoruba race worldwide made the disclosure during the celebrations of annual Aje Festival (deity of wealth) at Ile-Ife. He said that Nigeria is abundantly blessed with cultural tourism potentials capable of turning the country to a viable economic nation. The Arole Oduduwa noted that the county's cultural potentials should be productively showcased as culture does not affect religions saying culture does not even have a specific religion. He said: "As Christians or Muslims, we all need to respect our cultural heritage. In 2017, we prayed during the Aje Festival and we centred our prayers on the economic recession and within one week, we surprisingly experienced dollar crash from about N480 to N350. We have prayed and very soon, the economy will improve tremendously." "Aje is the spirit of market profitability. That is why its festival is very important to all humanity, because nobody can survive without it. If we do business, profit is expected, if you work you, expect stipends at the end of the month, so that is simply Aje," he explained.
