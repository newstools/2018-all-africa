Johannesburg â€” SOUTH African small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been encouraged to make the most of mobile marketing to reach wider audiences. The encouragement follows predictions by the Global System for Mobile (GSM) Communications that in 2018, an estimated 65,9 percent of the world's population of 7,6 billion people will own a mobile phone. This according to experts has implications for the way under-pressure SMEs reach their customers. According to the Banking Association of South Africa (BASA), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) provide employment to about 60 percent of the South African labour force and their total economic output accounts for roughly 34 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, 70 percent to 80 percent of small businesses fail within five years owing to runaway expenses and lack of access to technology. "Fortunately, mobile marketing is data-driven and this means small business owners always know what mobile is costing versus what it's delivering," says Mike Laws, founding Managing Director of Imaginatrix, a mobile marketing consultancy specialising in developing world markets and based in Johannesburg. Most mobile marketing consultancies will provide SME clients with an online dashboard to evaluate campaign effectiveness in realtime at no extra cost. "The tech-driven and virtually automated nature of mobile marketing means awesome reporting comes standard," Laws adds. Laws says for SME's, mobile technology is a gift waiting to be unwrapped. "... and it needn't cost the earth," Laws concludes.
