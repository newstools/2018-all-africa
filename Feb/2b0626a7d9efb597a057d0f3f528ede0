Former rugby player Derick Hougaard and local Afrikaans singer Nádine have taken their relationship to social media. After months of denying they were romantically involved the cat is finally out of the bag. Derick changed his Twitter profile photo to a loved-up photo of the couple together in January, and since then the two have been exchanging flirty messages on social media. Nádine calls her bae by a nickname, "Dirkie" and Derick tweeted on one occasion that he is "luckiest man in the world." Derick and his ex-wife Afrikaans singer, Karlien van Jaarveld, officially divorced in 2015. The couple share two children together. The Juice
