The High Court has reversed the attachment of an upmarket Harare property after the wife of the debtor, who is the co-owner of the house, challenged the process on the basis that her own share had been unlawfully included in the attachment. Olivia Mukoko successfully challenged the attachment of the house that she jointly owned with her husband, Blessing Mukoko, after Stanbic Bank had sued the husband over a debt.
