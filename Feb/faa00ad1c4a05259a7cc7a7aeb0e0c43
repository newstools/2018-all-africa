Two Metrorail trains were set alight on Wednesday evening at the Durban and Berea stations in KwaZulu-Natal. Paramedics were called to Berea station on Wednesday at approximately 19:00 to find a train ablaze, said Garrith Jamieson, Rescue Care's operations director. "Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene to find a carriage well alight," he said. "The Durban fire department was in attendance and quickly extinguished the blaze before it spread." The second train was set alight at Durban station, he added. The fires severely affected traffic as Durban metro police closed off multiple routes around the stations while emergency personnel worked on the scene. Jamieson said passengers managed to evacuate the trains in time and no one suffered any injuries. "The cause of the fire is unknown at this stage. However, SAPS and the Durban Fire Department will be investigating further," he said. Source: News24
