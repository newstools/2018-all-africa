Gospel singer Bahati and wife Diana Marua have today welcomed a bouncing baby girl. The couple have named the baby Heaven Bahati. Bahati shared the good news with his fans on Instagram giving thanks and praise to God. "GLORY TO JESUS!!! This Morning this Girl Diana Marua has given me the greatest gift of life, bouncing baby girl 3.24 KG's. Help us welcome Heaven Bahati," Bahati proposed to Ms Marua last year in June. The two have been subjects of interest ever since he introduced her as his 'Prayer Partner'. They later tied the knot in an invite-only wedding in October the same year. Bahati already has a two year-old daughter, Mueni Bahati from a previous relationship. GLORY TO JESUS!!!
