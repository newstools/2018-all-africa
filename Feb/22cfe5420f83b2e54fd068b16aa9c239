As the month of love draws to an end, Ahneeka's charm seems to be going strong. Both Rico Swavey and Angel are very fond of Ahneeka but in different ways, as they explain. Angel has said previously that he really likes Ahneeka, but not romantically. He likes having her around because he feels relaxed around her. He further added that if he would get a girlfriend outside the House, he wishes for someone who is like Ahneeka. Last night at the Live Show, Ebuka asked her how she felt about Angel, and the blush on her face was just too visible to ignore. But has he communicated his feelings towards her clearly? One can only wonder because it looks like there might be some mixed signals on Ahneeka's side. Pouring the Sauce of Love Meanwhile, with Rico Swavey it's a different story. He has continuously told her how he feels but it seems he's constantly hitting a wall. Even when they were paired together he did mention to her that he's becoming drawn to her every day. He sat her down last night and told her 'he's available' but Ahneeka brushed him off. Could it be confusion or is she genuinely not into Rico Swavey and into Angel?
