Ugandan-born Oxfam International Executive Director Winnie Byanyima has appeared before the UK Parliament's International Development Committee, where she said her priority now was to ensure no more mistakes were made by the British charity. Oxfam revealed it was investigating 26 new cases of sexual misconduct since a crisis erupted over its handling of a 2011 scandal involving sex workers in Haiti.
