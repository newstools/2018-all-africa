Abuja â€” THE Boko Haram terror group has killed over 2 000 teachers, displaced 19 000 others and destroyed 1 400 schools during its deadly campaign northeast of Nigeria. This emerged amid outrage by the international community after the Islamic radicals kidnapped more than 100 schoolgirls during an attack on the Bursari Government Girls Science Secondary School in the Yobe State last Monday. Virginia Gamba, the United Nations (UN) Special Representative Children and Armed Conflict, condemned the new attack on education in Nigeria. She lamented that attacks by Boko Haram focused on the abduction, forcible recruitment and use, killing and maiming as well as sexual abuse of Nigerian girls. "These abhorrent crimes must stop now. I call on all those with the means to engage to stop these violations and return our girls unharmed," Gamba said. Marie-Pierre Poirier, UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) West and Central Africa Regional Director, denounced the attack and called for the immediate and unconditional release of all the girls kept in captivity. "No words can console a family sending a child to school and not seeing her return home," Poirier said. She pointed out the Boko Haram also abducted 276 schoolgirls in Chibok, also in the northeast, four years ago. "And now comes this new horror. This is not just an attack on a school. It is an attack on all of us," Poirier said. The Boko Haram insurgency started in 2009 as the militants sought to overthrow the government and establish an Islamic state. An estimated 100 000 civilians have been killed and 2 million displaced.
