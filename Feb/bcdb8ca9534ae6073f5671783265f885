Police are holding Godfrey Wamala alias Troy, the prime suspect in the death of populary music artist, Moses Ssekibogo alias Mowzey Radio. Luke Owoyesigire, the Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesperson, says Wamala was picked up on Sunday evening from his hideout in Kyengera in Wakiso district. "He is the prime suspect and he has been on the run. Until yesterday we were still looking for him, "Owoyesigyire told URN. Wamala is alleged to have assaulted and pushed Mowzey Radio to the ground on January 22 as he was being led out of a hangout, De Bar in Entebbe. The artist became unconscious and was rushed to Nsambya hospital before he was moved to Case clinic, where he breathed his last on Thursday last week. Wamala was implicated by a number of witnesses interviewed by police as well as the other two suspects including the proprietor of the bar and bouncer. According to Owoyesigire, initially they had opened up a case of assault and causing grievous harm, but they are now looking at the murder. "The case is now murder since the victim died", he said. Police will however have to find credible evidence to push a murder case. While police can prefer tentative charges, only the Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) can analyse the evidence and sanction the charges. Preliminary information shows that trouble started after Mowzey opened a bottle of Black Label whisky and poured it on the revellers in the bar. This prompted the bar owner to order the bouncers to throw him out of the bar. It is alleged that Wamala grabbed Mowzey and threw him to the floor, cracking his skull in the process according to music producer Washington who claims to have been with the artist at the time. Mowzey was laid to rest at his home in Kagga, Nakawuka in Wakiso district on Saturday.
