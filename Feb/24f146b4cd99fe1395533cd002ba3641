Samantha the high tech sex doll, which ever since it was introduced has sent tongues wagging, has topped the list of the most searched item in Kenya in the month of January. The Samantha doll generated great public interest as it divided opinion between men and women, with the former welcoming the doll with cheers while the latter seemingly unhappy about it. The second most searched item is the KUCCPS 2018 intake.
