Analysts at Investdata Consulting Limited said expectations are high for short term positioning for Q4 earnings reports and continued volatility as traders jump back into the market on low price attraction ahead of dividend declaration. The Chief Research Officer of the company, Ambrose Omodion said" The relatively low interest rates in the money market and sell-off in the bond market will boost inflow into stock market as fund managers play earnings season for quick returns in high dividend paying stocks. "However, we would like to reiterate that investors should go for equities with intrinsic value, especially during this season that dividend payment is approaching. We advise investors to allow numbers guide their decisions while repositioning for the rest of the year's trading activities, especially now that stock prices remain volatile amidst improving company, economic and market fundamentals."
