Members of popular Facebook group Kilimani First Wives poured out their hearts at the prospects of their husbands ignoring them and taking mistresses for dates on Valentine's Day. The wives were discussing how mpango wa kandos should keep off as their men would be busy the whole day. Some wives were however sure their men would ignore them this Valentine's in preference to mistresses. The debate eventually turned to who, between the wife and mistress, deserves a treat during Valentine's Day. Here are some of the sentiments shared on the group. "Today not the best day to take your mpango wa kando (mwk) for a date. Very risky. First wives wako keen today like no other day," one wife wrote. "Kama kuna mtu nangoja wangu asahau niko na yeye leo in fact atanikuta kwa gate ya job na mngoja leo kamutu ameumia," another added. CHANGE OF DIET "Calm your titties and go to work. Mzee atakuja tu. Change of diet is good, you should try it too," one retorted. "The fact remains that your man is a cheat. If he can leave you and go take mwk out on Val's day, it means wewe hauko. Mwk is special whether being used or not," another commented. "Mwenye atapelekwa out leo ndiye special so watch your space and know your position," another advised. "Yaani am here stressed up coz wangu amechukua off we spend the day together and I had my own plans and you are there complaining of who is special than the other," another wondered. "Learn to love yourself more and such nonsense will never bother you," one wrote.
