Mr Wale Oloko, the Consul-General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Guangzhou, China, on Wednesday admonished young Nigerians aspiring to travel to China for employment purposes to look elsewhere. Oloko told said in Lagos that it had been and would continue to be difficult for unskilled Nigerians to secure even menial jobs among the Chinese. The consul- general, however, said that it was only "exceptionally skilled" Nigerians in artificial intelligence, Information Technology and other areas that could be considered for employment in China. "Nigerians wanting to travel to China for employments must appreciate the fact that China currently has a population of about 1.4 billion people. "And the Chinese government has to first be able to provide employment for them. "And besides, there is the language barrier for Nigerians wanting to get employment in China to contend with. "Let me therefore say that there are not much employment opportunities for Nigerians or other foreigners who want to travel to any part of China to do menial jobs," he said. The consul-general said that only Nigerians who were "exceptionally good" in some areas yet to be explored by the Chinese were likely to get employment offers in China. Oloko, who was visiting Nigeria so as to strengthen China and Nigeria relations, said that China was currently favourable to Nigerians who would be visiting for study, tourism and businesses. He said that the over 70, 000 Nigerians that travelled to the Guangdong Province in 2016, had visited the Chinese province for businesses, tourism, education and healthcare. (NAN)
