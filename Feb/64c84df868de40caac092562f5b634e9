Speaking in Lagos, Oloko said some Nigerians were also arrested for engaging in drug trafficking and other criminal offences. According to him, there were currently about 600 Nigerians arrested for overstaying their visas and in detention for other offences, saying : "There is no doubt that there are currently a number of Nigerians in various Chinese prisons, at least those under our consular jurisdiction in Guangzhou. These our nationals are in different Chinese prisons for various offences. There are those that were arrested for overstaying their visas, while others were convicted for drug trafficking and other offences." Oloko also said some of the Nigerian nationals currently in Chinese prisons were being prepared for deportation to Nigeria. The consul-general, therefore, enjoined Nigerians desirous of visiting any part of China to always obey immigration and general laws when in the province or other provinces in China. According to him: "Any Nigerian wanting to visit any part of China must first know something about the country's immigration requirements and should be ready to obey laws in such places when they eventually arrive there. It is not advisable for any Nigerian to overstay his or her visa in any part of China or engage in any form of criminal act." Guangdong, a province in South China is located on the sea coast.
