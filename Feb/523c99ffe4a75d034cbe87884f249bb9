"The Exchange has identified these companies that have exceeded the minimum listing rules standards in terms of timely disclosure of their annual audited and quarterly financial performance as early filers. We are extremely proud of these companies and will continue to showcase quoted companies that imbibe high corporate practices." Reaction from defaulting companies: All the defaulting companies failed to respond to Financial Vanguard enquiries except Skye Bank. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a top official of the bank attributed its default to regulatory delay. Shareholders react: Irked by the upsurge in number of companies flouting a very basic listing requirement of the NSE, shareholders said it is time for the management of the Exchange to review the sanction approach to forestall the rising trend. In separate interviews with Financial Vanguard, they unanimously advocated that the NSE should sanction the directors or company officials responsible for the default instead of sanctioning the company and hence indirectly sanctioning the shareholders. They also suggested that default occasioned by regulatory delays should not be penalised, adding that the Exchange should also introduce an incentive framework to encourage early submission. Mrs. Bisi Bakare, Chairman, Pragmatic Shareholders Association of Nigeria, said "my advice is that those officers of the companies assigned to process returns should do so as at when due to avoid unnecessary penalties. Also, our regulatory authorities should know that the burden or consequences of penalty is borne by shareholders. This is because the aftermath effect is that topline and bottomline will definitely be affected and dividend proposed will decline and the working capital of these companies will also affected. "On this note, I want our regulators to temper justice with mercy, by looking at other ways to punish these companies that flout listing rules than monetary fine so that our investment will not be affected. The regulators in the banking, capital market and insurance sectors (CBN, SEC, NAICOM) should be up and doing in their responsibilities because most times it is when one regulator or the other does not complete their work on time that it affect prompt filling of results by companies to the NSE." Mr. Boniface Okezie, Chairman, Progressive Shareholders Association of Nigeria, PSAN, said "The NSE need to further carry out investigation why these companies have failed to meet regulatory requirement. Imposing of fine is not the best, as this action affects the owners of the companies (shareholders) and not the management. It is only when such action is taken and the company fails to provide reasonable reason that a fine could be imposed; and the fine should be imposed on all the officers responsible to turn in the results and not to the firm itself. Also, the Exchange and other regulators should compel companies to state reason for late fillings of results in their annual reports. This will enable shareholders to tackle and hold the management responsible during Annual General Meetings, AGMs . Commenting as well, Mr. Moses Igbrude, Public Relations Officer, Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria, ISAN, said "There are rules and regulation in our market and operators must abide by them. So, management of companies should be aware of the rules and penalties involved. The management, as our Association always tells them, is to guide against being penalised. Another issue why some companies do not meet regulatory requirement, is because of the numerous regulators in our system. If one regulator delays a company from meeting the requirement of other regulators; should they be held responsible? No, I don't think it is proper. So, the NSE should look at this issue critically before imposing fine to defaulting companies. Sanctions is not always the best as we normally advise. We think regulators should find a way of rewarding those that meet regulatory requirements; in that case others will learn and be attracted to get such reward subsequently. "Again even when penalties are to be imposed, the officers or directors responsible to turn in results should be punished. We frown at a situation where the entire company or shareholders bear the brunt of the negligence of some few officers. If that is done, you will see that the directors will sit up and do things that will not attract penalty to the company." Mr. Owolabi Peter, Chairman, Integrated Supreme Shareholders Association of Nigeria, said "In as much that sanction is necessary to make the companies sit up, it is still not the best form of punishment. It is the shareholders' investment that suffers most. Whether there is fine or not directors are paid their money. The money used in paying these fines is shareholders' fund. I think regulators should rather sanction officers directly involved for failing in his or her responsibility. In that way they will sit up to avoid unnecessary penalty."
