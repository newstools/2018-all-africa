Ben Enwonwu's 1974 painting of the Ife princess Adetutu Ademiluyi, known as Tutu, went missing after his death in 1994. The painting became a symbol of national reconciliation in the country and people would hang posters of it on the walls in their homes. The whereabouts of the other Tutu paintings remain a mystery.
