Kenya Film Classification Board will not allow advertising of popular sex doll Samantha in media outlets. KFCB boss Ezekiel Mutua likened the use of sex dolls to necrophilia (sex with a corpse). He made the remarks on Saturday during the celebration of Scouts Founder's Day in Nyeri Town. He said that the even though KFCB does not have mandate over importation of sex toys, it would not allow anybody to advertise the product. "Anybody who dares to advertise those things will have KFCB to reckon with. Our mandate is on what Kenyans consume and advertising such things is immoral and wrong," he said. "You cannot promote sex with a robot as a way of life. We must protect our children from such things. In my view there is no difference between having sex with Samantha and having sex with a corpse," he said. The KFCB boss said that the board would partner with other government agencies to stop the importation of the sex dolls. Samantha has become a subject of discussion and satire on media platforms. Mutua at the same time announced that the crackdown on public service vehicles airing pornographic content will continue. He said matatus should not be used as conduits of airing indecent videos, adding that the culprits would be firmly dealt within the law.
