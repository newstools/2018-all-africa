Ugandan police say they have arrested the main suspect in singer Mowzey Radio's death. In a message posted on their official Facebook page, the police said the man is most probably the one who inflicted the injuries that eventually claimed the life of the celebrated singer during a brawl at the De Bar in Entebbe last month. "The suspect Wamala Godfrey was found at a friend's home in Kyangera where he has been hiding. He is recording a statement at Katwe Police Station and will be transferred to Entebbe Police Station," the police statement read.
