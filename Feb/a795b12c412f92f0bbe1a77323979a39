Port Harcourt â€” The Nigerian Navy will in the next few weeks receive more sophisticated ships in furtherance of government's determination to fortify the Nigerian armed forces to stem increasing security challenges in the country. Minister of Defence, Mansur Mohammad Dan-Ali, stated this at the Nigerian Naval College, Onne, Rivers State, where the Navy commissioned 118 cadets after successful completion of the Direct Short Service Course 24. Represented by the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Gabriel Olanisakin, the Defence Minister said the expected new naval ships, just like the graduation of more junior level leaders in the newly commissioned trainees, will complement the recent successes of the Navy in protecting the nation's waterways. He said: "With the lifeblood of Nigerian economy domiciled predominantly at the sea, the nation has over the years depended on the Navy to secure its resources, national assets as well as its sea lines of communications."
