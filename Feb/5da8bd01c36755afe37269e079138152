Artists and founders of Majikville Magazine Gabriel Chakanyuka and Nyasha Eugene Tendengu are enjoying the fruits of their hard work after launching a new magazine. The two began their partnership some years ago with Chakanyuka producing music for Tendengu and they later decided to create a magazine platform for their work. "It was always hard to get exposure, so we decided to create our own platform. We have pride in Africa and its diverse colourful cultures which promote healthy creative works, hence we took this step to document rising stars. "Majikville Magazine as a brand provides a platform for those struggling to rise to their full potential in arts by encouraging them to come out and present their works to the world." said Tendengu. Inside the magazine, one will find profiles of established and upcoming artists from musicians, actors, poets, sculptors and entertainers. "We believe talent should not end behind closed doors when it can elevate people to their full potential. We encourage productivity and creativity through publishing different kinds of intellectual works," Tendengu said. Majikville has featured award winning musician Cindy Munyavi, rapper Mc Chitah, popular Zambian star J10 and Twerk Queen Mixxy from Jamaica among others. Other than the magazine the duo has ventured into business. "We partnered with Kerbourchad Zvoushe aka DJ Electric on our second issue and he came on board with numerous ideas. Now we have various projects including our energized water, still water and ready-to-drink Juice," he said. Plans to launch an online radio and television channel are already on board. "From the magazine came the blue print for Majikville Radio and MajikTV. We plan to launch them later this year," said Tendengu. Majikville Magazine is available online in pdf format for download and is currently at its sixth issue.
