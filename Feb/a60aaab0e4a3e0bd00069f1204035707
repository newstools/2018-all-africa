Zimbabwe's only cryptocurrency exchange, Golix, recently reached a huge milestone after clearing over 2 000 customer support tickets in less than two weeks. Golix, known for allowing Zimbabweans to make international cross border payments more effectively, achieved the feat after increasing its customer support desks by 500 percent by end of last year. The firm -- which is three years old -- accumulated more than 2 000 support tickets from customers wanting assistance with trading, both buying and selling of mostly Bitcoin, to allow Zimbabweans battling US dollar shortages to process international payments. Golix head of customer care support Nomsa Mukuze yesterday said the growth in blockchain technology has been exponential not just in Zimbabwe and Africa but worldwide. "With Golix having over 45 000 customers and growing, a fully equipped customer support team is a no-brainer. "Being on any and every platform to allow our customers to contact us was a necessity, while we look to building our 24 /7 support. Golix is growing on daily basis. It's within our interests that we answer to all our customers' inquiries and address complaints if they are raised. "As we target to be the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in Africa, we hold in mind that we also have to keep all our customers satisfied and hence the need to introduce more customer support channels," said Ms Mukuze. The company's chief executive office Mr Tawanda Kembo said they have made great strides in reassuring people that they are a legitimate firm which is in Zimbabwe to stay. Mr Kembo said it is crucial for companies that seek to be taken seriously in the financial technology business to make use of social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook.
