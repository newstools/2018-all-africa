Senegal has announced last week that it is banning commercial vehicles from plying the roads at night in an attempt to minimise accidents, Transport and infrastructure Minister Abdoulaye Daouda Diallo said in Porokhane on Thursday. Minister Diallo said with immediate effect, commercial vehicles will no longer be allowed to drive from 10pm to 6am every day to minimise road accidents. "The measure is deemed necessary to minimise accidents, as so many people die in accidents due the cause of late driving." He disclosed that 11 people died recently in car accident during ungodly hour of commercial vehicles plying on the road. At night time, many drivers encounter problems of car control in the darkness which results to accidents that claims lives and properties. Mr. Diallo said his ministry will do their best to make sure the high rate of car accidents is minimized for the welfare of the country. He made the comment while paying pilgrimage to honor Mam Dairra Bousso, the mother of Sering Amadou Bamba Mbacke, founder of the Murid sect in Porokhane.
