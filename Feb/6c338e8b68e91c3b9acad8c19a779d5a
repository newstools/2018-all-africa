The ANC has confirmed that a national executive committee (NEC) meeting - which was scheduled for Wedensday - has been cancelled after a "constructive discussion" between President Jacob Zuma and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa in Cape Town on Tuesday. The meeting will now be held on February 17 and 18, the dates on which a gathering had already been scheduled. The NEC has the power to recall the state president.
