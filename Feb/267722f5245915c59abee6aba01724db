Air Peace has announced plans to launch its Kano and Yola services on February 12 and 15 respectively. The services, the airline said, will cover Lagos-Kano-Lagos; Kano-Abuja-Kano; Lagos-Yola-Lagos; and Abuja-Yola-Abuja. The carrier had earlier fixed February 19 for commencement of its flights from Lagos to Freetown in Sierra Leone, Banjul in The Gambia and Dakar in Senegal, but with the addition of Kano and Yola, the airline will be launching five new routes in February alone. Air Peace, which also plans to start its flights to Dubai, London, Guangzhou-China, Houston, Mumbai and Johannesburg this year, said it would operate both morning and evening flights from Lagos to Kano. Corporate Communications Manager of the airlines, Chris Iwarah, said the new routes were a confirmation of the seriousness of its pledge to connect many domestic, regional and international destinations this year and make air travel seamless. Iwarah said: "We are delighted to announce that Kano and Yola will be joining our fast-growing route network on February 12 and 15 respectively. The new routes will come on stream just days before the launch of our flights to Freetown, Banjul and Dakar. "The huge expansion project is strategic to our vision to create dependable air connectivity and make travel experience seamless and comfortable.
