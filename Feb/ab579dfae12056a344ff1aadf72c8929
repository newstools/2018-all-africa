Birnin Kebbi â€” The Permanent Secretary of the Kebbi State Ministry of Agriculture, Alhaji Muhammed Lawal Shehu, has said any country that fails to invest in agriculture, no matter its status, is doomed to fail. While speaking during the Daily Trust/ Kebbi State Government Farmers' Interactive Forum held in Birnin Kebbi on Tuesday, Shehu submitted that it was the responsibility of government to provide the needed food for its citizens and that therefore, it must provide enabling environment for farmers for meaningful agricultural production. Shehu also argued that Nigeria's problem would be solved once the required attention was given to the agriculture sector. He enjoined government at all levels, their agencies and other development partners to support the development of agriculture and various initiatives to boost food production. He said there was the urgent need to support the Nigerian farmers, as well as empower youths by engaging them in agricultural production. He said this would help to reduce youth restlessness, drug addiction and other vices they were associated with. He added that the Kebbi State Government had engaged in massive agricultural production; particularly rice, to reposition its economy, empower its teeming youths and ensure food sufficiency in the state and the nation in general.
