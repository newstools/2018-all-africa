The Ugandan government and Rift Valley Railways (RVR) are back in court. The government first terminated the firm's concession to run the Uganda-Kenya line in October 2017, and after a series of court appearances and discussions, finally ordered the Uganda Railways Corporation to take over. Now, RVR has filed a fresh notice for arbitration.
