Ado-Ekiti â€” A retired Ekiti-born captain in the United States Army, Sunday Adebomi, says Nigerian security agencies need special training to combat the killer herdsmen, noting that the operations of the nomads could be likened to insurgency or guerrilla warfare that requires innovative skills and dexterity. During a chat with newsmen in Ado-Ekiti, the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant regretted the killing of some security men by the herdsmen in Benue State, saying the action suggests that a special training was needed to further equip law enforcement agents for the counter-insurgency war. His words: "The anti-open grazing laws being enacted by some states are good, but curtailing insurgency is more than that. You need special skills to bring them down. I laughed when I heard Governor Ayodele Fayose rallying the local hunters against the killer herdsmen. Local hunters are trained to kill animals and not human beings. "I want to assure you that I will invite American soldiers to train our local people to secure Ekiti if I become governor at the July 14, 2018 polls. "Governor Kayode Fayemi introduced the Peace Corps in 2013 but was scrapped by Fayose. This security outfit could be trained by an international security body and such could be replicated nationwide." Adebomi promised to diversify the state's economy by investing in Ikogosi Warm Spring, packaging the local Igbemo rice as well as encouraging the youths in commercial agriculture to boost her revenue profile. He said he would attract local and foreign investors to turn around the state's macroeconomic sector, including agriculture, commerce and industry, education, health and infrastructure. The gubernatorial hopeful continued: "Our intention is to promote affordable, qualitative and functional education from the primary to the tertiary level. We shall institute merit-based scholarship where students of Ekiti origin can access funds to study to any level."
