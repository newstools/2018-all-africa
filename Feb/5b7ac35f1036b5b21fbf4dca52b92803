Gaborone â€” BOTSWANA aims to demonstrate its ability and pledge to operating a stock market of global standards when its hosts the 27th meeting of the Africa Middle East Depositories Association (AMEDA) in April. The Botswana Stock Exchange (BSE) and Central Securities Depository Botswana (CSDB) will organise the event in the north-eastern Kasane. Some 28 full members and eight affiliate members of AMEDA from over 30 countries will descend on the tourist town's Cresta Mowana Safari Lodge on April 11-12. "Hosting this meeting is a huge achievement for the BSE and Botswana as a whole as it will be the first time that the AMEDA meeting is held in Botswana. This, therefore demonstrates our prowess and our commitment to building a world class securities exchange," said Thapelo Moribame, BSE Head of Market Development. AMEDA meetings are dedicated towards the review of the association's financial performance, as well as conducting workshops on the relevant topics that impact the operations of the Central Securities Depositories in the AMEDA region. AMEDA is a non-profit organisation comprised of central securities depositories and clearing houses in Africa and the Middle East. It was formed for the benefit of its member community, as an elective, inter-professional and regional facility geared towards fostering the spirit of cooperation, reciprocity and harmony among members. Its main purpose is to provide a forum for the exchange of information and experiences among its members in a spirit of mutual cooperation. The CSDB, a 100 percent owned subsidiary of the BSE, was established in 2002. It joined AMEDA in 2012.
