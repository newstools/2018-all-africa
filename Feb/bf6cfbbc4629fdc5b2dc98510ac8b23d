After spending the last week awaiting feedback on their fates in the House, the Big Brother Naija housemates were on Sunday able to collectively heave a sigh of relief upon discovering the evictions were a hoax. Hosted by the ever suave Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, Sunday's live show was yet more entertainment for studio guests and viewers at home as Nigerian songbird, Niniola thrilled with her hit tracks Maradona and Sicker. The housemates' relief was however short-lived, as they were yet again tasked with competing for the Head of House title. An interesting twist occurred as all the male housemates and Vandora were disqualified from the challenge, following their failure to adhere to Big Brother's instructions. Khloe subsequently emerged as Head of House after competing with previous contestants, Ifu and Bam Bam. Things are, however, bound to get testy as the real nominations happen on Monday the 12th of February with the first set of evictions to follow on the next live show, with host Ebuka announcing that more than one pair of housemates will be evicted.
