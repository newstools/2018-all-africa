Maiduguri â€” BOKO Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, is reportedly disguising himself as a woman to evade capture by the Nigerian military. The Nigerian Army said information from arrested and surrendered insurgents disclosed the masquerade. He is said to desperately trying to escape the theatre disguised as a woman dressed in hijab. It is a head covering worn in public by some Muslim women. Brigadier General Sani Kukasheka Usman, the Director of Nigerian Army Public Relations, said the military had reliably gathered that to avoid detection, Shekau alternated between blue and black coloured hijabs. "He was last seen in a black hijab," said Usman. "We therefore call on all those remaining Boko Haram terrorists to know that they are following a coward moving about in hijab disguised as a woman." Usman said efforts were ongoing to track and apprehend the terrorist leader. He appealed to members of the public in the terror hotspots of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States to be vigilant and security conscious. "They must be on the lookout of Abubakar Shekau and other terrorists that might disguise as women to escape." Shekau is the most wanted member of the Islamist terror group. The army has previously claimed to have killed Shekau, only for to emerge with new threats and perpetrating more killings.
