The pair have been disqualified after getting three strikes issued by Big Brother. The first strike for the pair was recorded during the first week of the show, when K-Brule jumped and intentionally hurt himself. The second strike was issued to Khloe who was found guilty of using abusive and strong language in the house, while K-Brule got the third strike for manhandling and threatening to physically abuse a fellow housemate.
