"After a painstaking effort by the security agencies, Austin was traced to his hideout at a location along New Sapele Road, Obiaruku in Ukwani Local Government Area (LGA) in Delta State in the early hours of February 14, 2018. "He was among the killer squad that killed 23 worshippers returning from the cross-over vigil on January 1, 2018 at Omoku, Rivers State," Mr. Iliyasu said. The army said the suspected cultist and his members were planning a reprisal attack on security agencies, worship centres and schools in Rivers state.
