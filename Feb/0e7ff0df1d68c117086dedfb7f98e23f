Lagos â€” There was more drama and suspense on Sunday's live show as the Big Brother Naija (BBN) housemates were eager to know their fate in the house. There was however no eviction as the newly-paired housemates were given time to create some chemistry within themselves, even as more twists occurred following a routine exercise by the BBN which saw team 'TENA' gain immunity from next week's evictions. Sunday's show took off with performances by R&B crooner Praiz who rendered the hits 'Rich & Famous', and 'Me & You'. The dynamic DNA twins also performed, premiering their latest single 'Adanma' on the Big Brother Naija stage. The pair of Nina and Teddy A, also known as 'TENA' came out as favourites in the BBN house after housemates were told to nominate their favourite pairings in the house earlier in the week. This means that they now have immunity from being nominated for next week's eviction. Other housemates will however have to fight for their survival in the BBN house as nominations for the next round of evictions resume on Monday (today). Voting for nominated housemates begins at 6.30 pm Nigerian time and closes at 9.30pm Nigerian time on Thursday. Viewers can vote via SMS, mobile and website.
