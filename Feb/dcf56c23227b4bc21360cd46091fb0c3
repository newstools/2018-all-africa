Tanzanian singer Diamond Platnumz plans to bring competition to the doorstep of his Kenyan rivals with a new music studio for his record label Wasafi in Nairobi. The singer announced this week on his Facebook page plans to set up the studio and asked fans to tag all Kenyan artistes they would like to be signed by his record label. He also went ahead to post a video of a young man singing to his song, 'Haleluya' that he collaborated with Jamaican singers Morgan Heritage. "As we are about to Launch @wcb_wasafi Branch in KENYA...
