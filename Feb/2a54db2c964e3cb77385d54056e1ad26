A 'racist' comedy sketch on China's most popular Lunar New Year TV show has sparked worldwide outrage for appropriating African culture and using blackface. Viewers in China expressed shame at the portrayals and regret that their country had perpetrated negative stereotypes. The skit was apparently intended to celebrate Chinese-African ties but it all went downhill after a black performer playing a monkey appeared on stage next to an Asian actress in blackface makeup and a giant fake bottom.
