Fanaga â€” The explosion of a remnant of war seriously injured a woman in eastern Jebel Marra on Monday afternoon. The item of unexploded ordnance (known as UXO) detonated south of Fanaga. It resulted in the the amputation of one of the legs of 35-year-old Hawa El Rashid Saleh. One of her relatives told Radio Dabanga that Hawa was collecting firewood in the area together with other people when something triggered the detonation of the UXO . The victim was transferred to the health centre of Fanaga. Last month, a 16-year-old child died as a result of an explosion in Tawila locality in North Darfur, in the outskirts of the Jebel Marra mountains. Two other children lost their hands. Years of conflict have left Darfur and other war-torn areas of Sudan littered with unexploded ordnance (UXO). Radio Dabanga appeals to listeners throughout the region (and elsewhere in our reception area) not to touch any 'unexploded' grenades or other ammunition found in the field. Mark its position clearly to alert others, and report it immediately to a camp elder, Unamid and/or the local police.
