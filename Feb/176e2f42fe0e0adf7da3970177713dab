Gospel musician Elder Makedenge believes his second album "Huyai Tinamate" will assist a number of souls to come closer to God. In an interview, the upcoming musician said he was after soul searching and his music was mostly worshiping songs. "We are looking forward to turn a number of people's livesthrough music and that is the why my first and second albums have worshipping songs," he said. Makedenge started music when he was a member of the Apostolic Faith church in Highfield in 1988. "We had a very vibrant youth choir which at times was led by brother Freedom Sengwayo by then. I used to be a very good member of the choir but I was very afraid of getting into the studio to record," he said. He was inspired by Sengwayo together with his father who kept encouraging him to compose his own songs. "They kept on encouraging me to have touching songs so that they can search souls of the people," he said. He said he was making plans to have the album launched in the capital. "Currently we are in the process of organising a launch of this album together with the some of the elders that I sing with," he said. Makedenge said he was working also to have several collaborations with different musicians such as Fungisai Zvakavapano-Mashavave. "We also have upcoming jazz artist who is doing very well and is also one of my group members Aim Nemashakwe a saxophonist whom I wish to give a chance on songs with other musicians. My first collaboration will be with Fungisai Zvakavapano," he said.
