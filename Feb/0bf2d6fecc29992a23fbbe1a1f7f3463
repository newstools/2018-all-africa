Optimum Coal Mine is owned by the embattled Gupta family, close friends of former president Jacob Zuma who were named in the State of Capture Report by former public protector Thuli Madonsela, as having had an influence on the former president in his appointment of key cabinet ministers, and the awarding of lucrative tenders to them. The coal mine is currently either in the process of being sold or is facing closure, and miners have downed tools, demanding answers about their future.
