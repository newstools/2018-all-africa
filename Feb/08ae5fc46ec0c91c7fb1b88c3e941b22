President Jacob "the people still love me" Zuma has been at the centre of many storms during his tenure, including surviving eight motions of no-confidence in parliament. Most prominent has been the upgrades to his Nkandla home at taxpayers expense, the state capture report by former public protector Thuli Madonsela accusing the president of handing the country over to his friends the Gupta brothers who benefited from lucrative government tender contracts and other deals. In December 2017, the African National Congress vote Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa into the leadership role of the African National Congress. The country now has two centres of power, a situation with which the ruling party itself is at odds with, while they try and "convince" President Zuma to step down. He has reportedly refused, so the nation waits for the next move as the postponement of the state of the nation address on February 9, was announced. A caucus meeting was held by the African National Congress today.
