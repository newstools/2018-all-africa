Rumour has it that even though fallen Ugandan artiste Mowzey Radio died while still under the Goodlyfe label, he had plans to part ways with his long term music partner Weasel, something that has been refuted by the duo's management camp. Before Radio's death, he had more than 20 songs lined up, on a solo project. The songs were under a label called 'Angel Music' and this is what sparked the rumour. But sources assert that Radio started 'Angel Music' with another Ugandan artiste, Michael Ross, who is currently majoring in gospel music. It is said that the two decided to do a gospel album under 'Angel Music' as a branch outside the Goodlyfe label. The 12 track album was done albeit only two songs were released, including Radio's own TambulaNange. Are Charly na Nina telling lies? To the shock of many, this week, celebrated duo Charly na Nina split from Decent Management, a company they've been signed to for the last five years. Social media was buzzing with questions about what could've happened between the girls and Decent Management's Alex Muyoboke who is known to 'spin straw into gold.' The duo said that they wanted to take control of their music career and set up their own management company and promote their own music. But sources close to Muyoboke say fame and success has gotten to the girls' heads and forgot where they came from. It is alleged that Muyoboke was incensed that the duo forgot where he got them to put them to their current level and they suddenly think they don't need him! Indeed, this rumour could hold water because it is unlikely that successful musicians with a busy schedule can have time to manage their own schedules, bookings and promote music on top of performing and being in studio? So could the duo be lying about the real reason they parted ways with Muyoboke? If rumors are to go by the duo are likely to get another agency to manage them. Sources in Kampala say the duo is being lured to join Jeff Kiwa of 'Team No Sleep' (TNS) who has managed many big artistes in Uganda. Snoops say Kiwa is eyeing the two girls to join his label. Kiwa works with different artistes like Sheebah and also worked with Radio&Weasel, Jose Chameleone, and Pallaso, among others. Other sources say the split could be linked to Denis Rwema who previously worked under Decent Entertainment but later decided to join another music agency, Kiwundo Entertainment. Some say Rwema quit Muyoboke's company over disagreements and wants to sign the girls on his new label. We will keep you posted. ************************************************** Sentore and Buravan to perform at Miss Rwanda finale If there is something that people look forward to at the grand finale of the Miss Rwanda beauty pageant, it is the performances by selected musicians. Previous performances were criticised by the general public with many saying that the chosen musicians didn't fit within the cultural confines in line with the pageant. This year, sources say that organisers are looking at Jules Sentore, a traditional singer and Yvan Buravan to perform at the grand finale of this year's competition tomorrow. ************************************************** Chameleone extends charity to orphans Singer Chameleone filled Goma grounds in DRC over the weekend and also extended his giving heart to the DR Congo people. After his successful show in DRC, the ValuValu singer, visited Don Bosco Ngagi orphanage and donated items worth $3000. The singer supplied the orphanage with bags of rice, posho, sugar, beans and boxes of soap to young unprivileged children in the camp. "It does not make sense for me to come here and make up to $30,000 and I not even leave 10 per cent of it to the people that gave it to me," he said. Chameleone has previously been involved in Charity under his charity organisation "Chameleone Foundation" where he has schooled children and provided basic needs for the needy. ************************************************** Football star Makenzi to walk down the aisle We are told that former Rayon Sports football player Makenzi is in the country for his wedding.
