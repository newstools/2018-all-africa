Khartoum â€” Khartoum and Ankara may soon agree on the first copper factory to be established in eastern Sudan's Red Sea state. On Thursday, Turkish MP Shaheen Teng met with the Sudanese Minister of Minerals, Dr Salim Ali Salem concerning the new project. In a press conference following the meeting, Teng said that the Turkish Genghis Company has announced its desire to establish a copper factory in Sudan, in partnership with the Ariab Mining Company - owned by the Sudanese government. He referred to the directives of the governments of Sudan and Turkey to increase the volume of trade between the two countries from $ 2 billion to $ 10 billion. "We will seek to take advantage of Sudan's mineral infrastructure to reach and surpass those figures," the MP noted, according to the Sudanese News Agency (SUNA) on Thursday. The Governor of the Red Sea state, Ali Hamid, welcomed the new project. "We look forward to the establishment of the first copper factory in Sudan at the Ariab mine, which contains huge reserves of more than five tons of gold," he said. In December last year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan paid a two-day visit to Sudan. The two countries signed a number of agreements to boost economic partnership, with emphasis on technology, agricultural and industrial production, mining, and the development of small and medium businesses.
