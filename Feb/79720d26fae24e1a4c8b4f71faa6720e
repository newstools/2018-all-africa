As the nation strives toward becoming a leading hub for tourism in Africa, fresh indication emerged that over 100, 000 Nigerians can be employed in the sector in one year. Speaking during the unveiling of the February edition of the Entrepreneur Africa Magazine in Lagos, Chairman, Federation of Tourism Association of Nigeria, FTAN, Mr. Wemi Jones, said if Nigerians tap into the opportunities in tourism, many people will be employed within a space of twelve months. Jones said: "It may not be job that pays N500, 000 per month, but nobody will be idle. There is no part of Nigeria you get to that lacks tourist attractions. "There is no place in Nigeria that does not have one form of tourism or the other. Federal government needs to assist in creating enabling environment, most especially security and infrastructure and allow people to come in and invest. "But it won't be a good ideal for government to run it, rather, it should allow private sector to be fully involved, because the federal government cannot run it well. Government can take share from it but they shouldn't be solely in charge. This will help create jobs for youths Jones also explained that, "There is place in Kabba village called 'Obangogo' every year we climb the mountain. Look at Olomo rock in Abeokuta. After the state government refurbished it and installed elevator there so that if you cannot climb, you enter lift to go up. You pay money for that. Somebody put a fast food and other stuffs, there, and they are earning good income. It got their people employed. "Assuming the government didn't structure the place the way it's structured now, those opportunities will not be there."
