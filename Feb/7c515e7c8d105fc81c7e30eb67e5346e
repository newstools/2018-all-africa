Speaker of House of Representatives, Mr Yakubu Dogara, on Tuesday, asked security agencies to take responsibility for failing to stop the abduction of 110 schoolgirls in Dapchi, Yobe, on Feb. 19. He said that the buck-passing between the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police Force was unacceptable. In a statement by Mr Turaki Hassan, his Special Adviser on Media and Public Affairs, Dogara said rather than trading blames, the security agencies should strengthen inter-agency collaboration towards rescuing the girls. He said that the statements credited to the Army and the Police in which they tried to exonerate themselves from any culpability in the unfortunate abduction of the girls from their school were highly condemnable. "This is unacceptable and the House of Representatives, and indeed Nigerians, will hold the security agencies responsible. They all bear responsibility for this unfortunate incident. "The traumatic experience of the Chibok abduction which is still fresh in our minds should have served as a warning signal to security agencies to provide adequate protection to all schools in the North-East. "I want to use this medium to console the parents of the abducted girls and the entire Dapchi community over this unfortunate incident. "I also urge all Nigerians and people of goodwill from all over to pray for the safe return of the girls," Dogara said
