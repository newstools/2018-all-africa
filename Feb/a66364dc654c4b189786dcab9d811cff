"Don't ignore Africa," Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo said in the first address by an African leader to the U.S. National Governors Association in Washington, DC. "Immense opportunities exist for American capital, technology and enterprises in Ghana," he said. Following the speech, the President left the U.S. to participate in the German-African Economic Forum and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation's German-Ghana Business Forum as well as to hold talks with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He returns to the U.S. capital to take part in a forum organized by the Amercan-Israel Public Affairs Committee.
