The prime destination of Kariba is set to receive a huge boost with the municipality making land available for the building of a new airport. The current Kariba Airport cannot be expanded due to its location near a gorge. Transport and Infrastructure Development Minister Joram Gumbo has said the airport will encourage more tourists to visit and use it as a departure point by smaller planes, for destinations like Gonarezhou National Park and the City of Mutare. The town of Beitbridge has also been earmarked for an airport.
