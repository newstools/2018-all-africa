The United States Ambassador to Nigeria Mr Stuart Symington has said that the survival of the citizens is key to the existence of the country. Mr Symington said Nigeria had one of the strongest democracies in the world and that the citizens should approach the 2019 elections as one, saying the country should extend her goodwill to other West African countries and the entire continent in order to uplift them. Speaking during an interactive session with members of the House of Reps committee on Nigeria-US friendship and inter-parliamentary relations, headed by Rep Johnson Agbonayinma (APC, Edo), the US envoy said his country desired the kind of diversity Nigeria enjoys. "I came with two profound ideas. The first idea is after spending a little more than a year in your country and having visited 35 of your 36 states and spoke with the people and everyone, I've learnt a very important lesson. Nigeria is profoundly for citizens who want to have a say in making their future better together," he said.
