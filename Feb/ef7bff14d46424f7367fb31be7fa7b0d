The Chief Magistrate's court presided over by her Ms Mary Kaitesi has further remanded Mr Godfrey Wamala, alias Troy the main suspect in the death of singer Moses Sekibogo aka Mowzey Radio. Troy was on Monday sent back to Kigo government prison where he's on remand after prosecution said investigations into the case are still going on. State Prosecutor, Mr Julius Tuhairwe told court fully packed with relatives and fans of the deceased singer that investigations into his death were still ongoing. "Status on the matter before court is that investigations are not yet complete. Inquiries are still ongoing and I pray that the matter be adjourned for further mention," Mr Tuhairwe said. The chief magistrate remanded Troy who was charged with murder until March 19 when he will return to court for further mention of the case. Troy was again not allowed to take plea because the charges against him are grave in nature and can only be heard by the High Court.
