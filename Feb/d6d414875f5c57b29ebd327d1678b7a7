The Chinese Embassy in Nairobi on Sunday fought back claims of racism in a skit aired on Thursday by China's national broadcaster. The embassy said any perception of ill-will was from people who are not happy with Beijing's cooperation with Africa. PLAY Mr Zhang Gang, a spokesman of the embassy, told the Nation that the reports of malice were "ill-intended, totally distorting and smearing". He said the show was vetted by government officials before airing. In Mr Gang's view, Western media started the reports on racism.
