Since he ascended the throne, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi's dream, among others, is to turn the ancient city of Ile- Ife into a place that will attract tourists all over the world. Interestingly, the dream is becoming a reality. Spy Glass gathered that the well-travelled monarch has completed a billion-naira grand resort in the town that can compete with others across the world. A source revealed that the resort named Ife Grand Resorts and Leisure is built on a 252- hectare of land with a 300-room capacity. The resort, which boasts breathtaking scenery, will be officially launched in March. "There's nothing like this in the whole of West Africa, not even in Lagos.
