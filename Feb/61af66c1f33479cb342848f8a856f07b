Multi award winning Zimbabwean musician Mukudze Mukombe popularly known as Jah Prayzah says he has outdone himself and has achieved more than he ever hoped for. Jah Prayzah was speaking at the premier of his new duet song with Jamaican Reggae star, Jah Cure titled Angle-lo, where he said he used to look down upon himself but has risen above low self esteem to be a force to reckon with in the region. "I think I have achieved more than I expected in my career because some of the time I used to look down upon myself, but my talent kept on pushing me far and now I am being I am," said the lanky lad whose album Kutonga Kwaro is still receiving a fair share of airplay. He said he is happy to be working with international artists as it shows that he is destined for greater heights. He said working with Jah Cure was easy as the Jamaican is a humble person. "It was very easy working with Jah Cure on this project because he is someone who does not have pride. He has a very good work ethic and this made us produce a good song which we are excited about. "We are all musicians who sing and not rappers and combining reggae and afro beats was not a huge task for us," he said. The video which was shot in Spain, was released today on YouTube and MTV Base. "The reason why we shot the video in Spain was because Jah Cure is a fan of Barcelona and he wanted to watch some of the team's games and that also drove me to like the venue and we went and see the Barcelona for the first time. The video premier was attended by Chamu Chiwanza , a Harare businessman, who was celebrating his birthday on the day.
