Nigerian author and lawyer Reno Omokri was forced to issue an unreserved apology after confessing his love for ugali, but ate it with a fork. Omokri had confessed his love for ugali on Twitter, adding that he was worried no one in Nigeria would prepare him such delicious ugali. The author is presently touring Tanzania and Kenya. He said Mombasa was Africa's best kept secret, prompting a thank you tweet from Mohammed Hersi of the Kenya Tourism Federation. Kenyans were jazzed that Omokri loved their staple food, but quickly protested at the dishonourable manner he chose to devour it. The author quickly apologised for using a fork ,adding that he was going to use bare fingers to eat Ugali. I'm now so hooked on ugali. Mombasa's ugali is extra delicious. Who would prepare this traditional Tanzanian/Kenyan staple for me when I return home? pic.twitter.com/AEcea99yBh - Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) February 25, 2018 Enjoy.

Ugali shall henceforth be demolished with my bare fingers! pic.twitter.com/Hhc5OY6wvu - Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) February 25, 2018
