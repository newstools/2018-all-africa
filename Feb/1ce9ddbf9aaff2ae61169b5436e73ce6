Unicef Malawi has embarked on a campaign of distributing safe water on a daily basis to Mitengo community in Lilongwe, after the area recorded 10 cholera cases that claimed the life of a 10-year-old child. Unicef in partnership with the Centre for Development Control are using drones to map out cholera cases in Malawi's capital, Lilongwe.
