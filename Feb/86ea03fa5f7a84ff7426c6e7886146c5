Flamboyant tycoon Sulaiman Kabagala Mbuga, popularly known as SK Mbuga, has been arrested by Interpol over alleged fraud committed by his Swedish wife Vivienne Chebet. The couple have been in the spotlight after reports emerged in Sweden that their lavish lifestyle was funded by money they acquired fraudulently three years ago. Mbuga was allegedly trying to sneak out of the United Arab Emirates after receiving information that he was being sought by authorities.
