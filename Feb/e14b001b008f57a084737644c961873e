The Pan-African Parliament has pledged to support the Zimbabwe government in lobbying for the lifting of United States sanctions on the country. Since 2002, the US has maintained sanctions against the Zimbabwe government, mainly financial and visa restrictions on targeted individuals as well as the suspension of support at multilateral funders and cessation of direct aid.
