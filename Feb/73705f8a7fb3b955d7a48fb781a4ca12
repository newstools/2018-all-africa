The World Economic Forum (WEF) in its latest international travel and tourism competitiveness report indicated the figures compiled by the Ministry of Culture & Tourism of Ethiopia are not based on accurate statistics, which is not acceptable in principle internationally. The sector's performance report that was presented to the parliament by Hirut Woldemariam (PhD) minister of Culture & Tourism last month lacks accurate figures and has estimating errors, according to the WEF report. These estimates are mostly applicable for holiday, spare time or adventure travellers, where a tourist, on average, spends no more than two to three days in the capital, as the WEF estimate report indicates. The Ministry's report illustrates that over 485,806 tourists have visited the country during the first half of the current fiscal year, enabling the sector to generate 1.8 billion dollars, based on an estimated tourist stay period of seven days for conferences, according to the report. The Ministry has said that the performance has shown an increase of 10.5pc in the same period last fiscal year. However, the WEF estimation stated that the average stay of a business and conference tourist is two to three days.
