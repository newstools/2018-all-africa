Port Harcourt â€” The Nigerian Association of Seadogs (aka Pyrates) has asked the Federal Government to treat armed herdsmen as terrorists, saying their activities have led to death of scores of Nigerians and displacement of numerous communities. The group maintained that only terrorists would terrorise a country and its citizens like the dreaded herdsmen have been doing.It regretted that the activities of the nomads were tactically planned, yet government remains seemingly indifferent to an amicable resolution of the menace. The body made its position known at the weekend in Port Harcourt after a medical outreach at Oro-Ochiri community, Rebisi Town, Port Harcourt City Local Government Area to its second quarter's Pyrates Working Committee (PWC) meeting. The president, Arthur Boje, noted that the conventional nomads were not responsible for the attacks, adding that terrorists had invaded the country in the guise of herdsmen to cause unrest nationwide.He said: "We are not happy with the killings going on in parts of the country. There is no way you will be happy when your brothers and sisters are killed senselessly and the government is not doing enough to save the situation. "What those herdsmen are doing is orchestrated. It is tactically planned. There are persons that have infiltrated the country, aided by some people on ground and also sponsored by people here. "They are terrorists and the Federal Government should treat them as such. They are not herdsmen; they are professional killers brought from outside into the country to cause havoc." The chairman of Oro-Ochiri Community Council, Comrade Charles Kalagbor, commended the group for the medical mission, saying it would improve the health of the less privileged in the area.
