Day 23 at the BB Naija house was all about taking responsibility as the housemates were given baby dolls to take care of. Firstly, Big Brother tells the housemates that there would be a one week ban of cigarettes, alcohol to teach the housemates what it truly means to take responsibility for their actions. This did not go down well with the housemates but they had to grudgingly accept to avoid repercussions. Later in the day, Big Brother told the housemates to gather at the lounge and when they did, many were up for a big surprise as their envelopes contained the odd congratulatory message "You Have A Baby". Anto, Ahneeka and Alex were asked to step forward and acknowledge the gift of a child, and a moment later, three Ninjas emerged out of the elevator with three tiny baby cots, inside of which were three baby dolls. Big Brother said that the baby dolls needed to be bathed, soothed, sung lullabies to and cared for like human babies. The housemates looked like they had lost their bearings, and when the first baby cries filled the air, the entire room burst into a hearty laugh at the realisation of Big Brother's prank. They begrudgingly got on with the task for no one is willing to cross Big Brother anymore as the consequences are unbearable.
