Makurdi â€” Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has called for support from the federal government, public-spirited individuals, organisations, as well as the international community to tackle the humanitarian challenges associated with recent attacks by Fulani herdsmen. He spoke yesterday after visiting three camps of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Makurdi and Guma Local Government Areas maintaining that the influx into the camps have increased their number from five to seven with a total population of about 100, 000. The governor stated that although the state government has responded to the situation by providing relief materials and facilities at the camps, the influx has overwhelmed its capacity especially with those who fled from attacks in neighbouring Nasarawa State. He directed commissioners in the Ministries of Health and Water Resources to deploy more staff to the camps and also ensure adequate water supply. The governor reiterated his call on the federal government to rise up to its responsibility of protecting the lives and property of citizens by stopping the attacks and sanctioning those responsible for it. He stressed that the permanent solution to farmers and herders incessant clashes with attendant casualties remained ranching which is an international best practice in animal husbandry across the world. Ortom said it was unfortunate that in spite of his many letters informing the presidency and relevant security agencies of the attacks nothing was done to avert them which indicated that those in authority were accomplices. He restated his call for the arrest and prosecution of officials of the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore who threatened to invade the state in May last year and have sponsored the current attacks.
