The 82-year-old ex-Harambee Stars striker Joe Kadenge has expressed delight at getting the opportunity to watch his favourite team Manchester United play when he travels to the UK. The visit has been organised by Black Arrow, an American-based football media brand that will also document Kadenge's football journey.
