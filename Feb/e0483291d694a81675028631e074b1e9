Bonang Matheba was a vision in white as she kicked off the Grand White Dinner series in Cape Town on 24 February. The event, which took place at the Jan van Riebeeck Sports Field, welcomed over 1000 guests dressed in the traditional all-white attire with a memorable dove ceremony where dozens of white doves were released to mark the true meaning of the event - peace, love and unity. Musical acts performing on the day included Mafikizolo, Swing Collective and DJ Lloyd. Also taking to the stage with a magical performance were a few members of the South African National Circus. Additional cities added to the Grand White Dinner calendar for 2018 include Johannesburg, Durban and Pretoria, as well as international cities like Lagos, New York and Los Angeles. Speaking on the event in Cape Town, Bonang said in a statement: "It was the most wonderful day, just bringing people together and getting everyone to share in peace, love and unity. Everything was fabulous and I look forward to celebrating with my fans in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Durban." Source: Supplied
