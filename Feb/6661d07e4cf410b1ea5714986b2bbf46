Big Brother Naija 2018 ex-housemate, Kbrule, who was disqualified alongside Khloe on the show last Sunday, has revealed that he cannot date Khloe. He also said that he's sad to have disgraced his mother and his fans. Speaking during a question and answer session organized by Payporte for evicted housemates on Instagram, Kbrule said he's quite angry with himself and he believed he should have done better on the show if only he had taken the caution and behaved himself while on the Big Brother Naija show. "I am angrier with myself for disgracing my mother letting her and my fans down. I want nothing more than to make it up" he said after a fan told him she was mad at him . When asked if he was going to go on with dating Khloe, he said "Hahaha Nah" and when further asked how he felt when Khloe kept insulting him in the house, he replied: "This poor broken lady is acting out of insecurity take it easy on her" Kbrule was then asked about the housemate that he would love to see evicted from the show and he responded saying:"I think Cee-C should leave."
