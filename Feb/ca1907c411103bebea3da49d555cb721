Maputo — The Portuguese Defence Ministry on Monday donated ten speedboats to the Mozambican navy, under the military cooperation agreement between the two countries. This was the first act covered by a new agreement signed in Maputo earlier in the day by Mozambican Defence Minister Atanasio M'tumuke and his Portuguese counterpart, Jose Azeredo Lopes. The ten speedboats cost 40,000 euros (about 50,000 US dollars) and each can carry a maximum of five people. Speaking at the ceremony, M'tumuke said this support consolidates the existing bilateral cooperation in the military area. He said the boats should assist the navy, particularly in moving equipment to and from larger vessels. “This is a gesture that continues cooperation which began in 2012”, he added. He stressed that the presence of Mozambican soldiers undergoing training in Portugal, and of Portuguese instructors in Mozambican military academies shows the interest of the two countries in boosting their military cooperation. Lopes said the speedboats will contribute to Mozambique's maritime security, and were an expression of common values, notably the obligation “to protect each of our countries from the increasing threats and challenges that we are facing in the 21st century”. He believed that the cooperation between the two defence ministries had been fruitful, and promised that the Portuguese armed forces will continue to work with their Mozambican counterparts.
