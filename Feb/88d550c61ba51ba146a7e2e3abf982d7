Miguna Miguna has received a warm welcome on arriving in Canada earlier today. A handful of men and women awaited for him at Toronto International Airport, and Mr Miguna was presented with a bouquet of flowers upon arrival. "Welcome 'general'! Welcome home," a woman said when she saw him. "Miguna Miguna, how are you?," a man asked him. "I am tired," he replied. "Kenyans are watching you, they want to hear a word from you," Miguna was told.
