January might be a chance for a fresh start and New Year resolutions, but the month always seems to go on far too long for many. For that reason, Kenyans on Twitter on Wednesday celebrated the end of the infamous Njaanuary and the same time welcomed February with hilarious tweets. While most of them were happy to see the end of January, others cautioned against celebrating too much, saying February is often just as bleak. Here are some of the hilarious tweets that KOT shared regarding the end of Njaanuary: Happy New Month . Welcome 2018 njaanuary is over. Story ya kdf.
