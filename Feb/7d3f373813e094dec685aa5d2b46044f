Defence Minister Penda ya Ndakolo has reportedly admitted that he did not inform President Hage Geingob about the military's decision to purchase a U.S.$3,8 million farm. The purchase was made three weeks after the ministry announced that thousands of troops will be sent on leave because there was no money to feed them.
