The self-declared National Resistance Movement (NRM) 'general"' Miguna Miguna who was 'deported' to Canada on Tuesday night, had not renounced his Kenyan citizenship. This is according to his sensational book, 'Peeling Back the Mask', which he published shortly after his fallout with the then Prime Minister Raila Odinga's ODM wing of the grand coalition government in 2011. At the time, Mr Miguna argued that the PNU party, which at the time was part of the coalition government with ODM, had orchestrating the allegations with plans to deport him. KENYAN BY BIRTH "I am a Kenyan by birth. I have never renounced my citizenship. Citizenship isn't determined on the basis of passports," he writes. "Many people, including Nelson Mandela, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Mwai Kibaki, Raila Odinga, Robert Mugabe, Koigi Wamwere and Ngugi wa Thiong'o have travelled on other countries' passports; that didn't change their citizenship. My case isn't different." he argues in the book.
