SABC3 and Top Billing's Presenter Search on 3 will return from May for a fourth time, looking to add new South African TV talent to joins shows like Top Billing , Expresso or Afternoon Express . The Presenter Search on 3 will be produced by Tswelopele Productions with the search for a new presenter or presenters to join various SABC3 shows that is taking place to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the weekly gloss entertainment and lifestyle magazine show Top Billing . Previous seasons of the highly popular Presenter Search on 3 have made bona fide TV stars and celebrities of Simba Mhere and Jonathan Boynton-Lee with thousands of hopefuls who queued across the country in 2010 and in 2012 when it was known as My Top Billing Dream . The last season of Presenter Search on 3 was held in 2015 with the winners: Zoe Brown who joined Expresso , Danilo Acquisto who joined Afternoon Express and Jade Hubner who joined Top Billing . The show was however also a star vehicle launching pad for Chris Jaftha who made the Top 5 and was picked up soon afterwards by Top Billing as a presenter as well anyway, and who is currently also the co-presenter of Dancing with the Stars South Africa on M-Net (DStv 101). Likewise Mishka Patel was picked up to join Tswelopele Productions' weekly Afrikaans magazine show Pasella on SABC2. Contestants will be put through their paces in grueling real-life TV challenges before and behind-the-scenes with various presenting tasks taking place in-studio and shot outside on-location to not just test the telegenic mettle of those who want to be on TV but also their adaptability and how they respond to unexpected production curve-balls.
