School-going children along the borders of Wajir County are staring at a bleak future after non-local teachers began fleeing from schools on Friday after an attack suspected to have been executed by Al-Shabaab militants at Qarsa Primary School in which three people, including two teachers, died. Addressing journalists in Wajir Town the county Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) secretary Noor Bardad confirmed the mass exodus of teachers naming Khorof Harar Secondary school and primary, Wajir Bor, Riba, Sarman, Kutulo and Tarbaj among the schools that have been hard hit by the exit of the teachers. 15 SCHOOLS AFFECTED Fifteen primary schools are reported to have been affected by the exit of the non-local teachers who comprise over 60 percent of the staff in Wajir County. The exit of teachers from the schools in the last three days seems to replicate the 2015 incident where many teachers left various schools in the north eastern region after an attack on a Mandera bus that left several people dead, most of them non-local teachers. Mr Bardad further threatened to withdraw the teachers from terror-prone areas if leaders fail to come up with mechanisms that will guarantee security for the tutors.
