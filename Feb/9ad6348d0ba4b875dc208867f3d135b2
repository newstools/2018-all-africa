Worried by the unabated attacks and killings by suspected Fulani herdsmen, the General Overseer of Evangelistic Crusade Overcomers Ministry (ECOM), Rev. Gabriel Ade Ekunjesu, has called on the federal and state governments to advocate laws that will checkmate the attacks by herdsman on innocent citizens across Nigeria. Ekunjesu, who made this known in a chat with newsmen, blamed the attacks on insincerity and selfishness of Nigerian leaders. He said: "The leaders are unfaithful to their creator and untruthful to the citizens they lead, and as such, AK-47 wielding herdsmen may not be tamed, because those who make laws not also break the laws but turn a blind eye to activities of the marauding herdsmen. Speaking ahead of First Fruit service coming up on Sunday, February 4 at the church auditorium located at 18, Awawu Street, Mushin, Lagos, Ekunjesu reiterated that laws were meant to be kept, as such, herdsman were not exempted from such, including legal possession of gun. "Cattle rearing is a personal business, and government should not be involved in it at all. Federal and states governments should make laws that will discourage herdsmen from grazing or encroaching on people's land," he stated. The First Fruit service is an appreciation service held in advance of what to expect God to do throughout the year. It will also be used to launch the church's calendar.
