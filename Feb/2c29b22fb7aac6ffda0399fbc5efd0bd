Police in Ugandan have taken into custody a woman who was caught on Tuesday at the gravesite of Ugandan singer Moses Ssekibogo aka Mowzey Radio. According to a tweet on NTV Uganda's Twitter handle, the woman, identified as Maureen Namuli, was believed to be performing acts of witchcraft. Police later took the woman - who appeared restless on video footage produced by NTV Uganda - to Butabika mental hospital in Kampala where she was expected to undergo an examination that would determine her mental state. The Ugandan singer died last week from injuries he sustained during a brawl in a bar in Entebbe and was buried at his mother's home on Saturday. As this was happening, a court in Entebbe has remanded the suspected killer of the musician. Godfrey Wamala alias Troy, a businessman and resident of Kyengera LC1, Nsangi Town council in Wakiso District was on Wednesday remanded to Kigo government prison by Entebbe chief magistrate Mary Kaitesi. The suspect, who is being represented by renowned Human rights lawyer, Ladislous Rwakafuuzi, will remain in remand until February 26, 2018 pending the completion of police investigations.
