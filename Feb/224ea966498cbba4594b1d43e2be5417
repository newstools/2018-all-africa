As the adage goes; Scratch my back, I scratch yours, hospitalised Ugandan musician Moses Ssekibogo, best known as Mowzey Radio alongside his singing partner Weasel were part of the Tubonga Nawe project that partly contributed to President Museveni's campaigns ahead of the 2016 elections. On Tuesday, Mr Museveni also showed his support to the Goodlyfe member by donating Shs30m towards his treatment as he remains bedridden for more than a week now. Balaam Barugahara, an events promoter confirmed the donation through a post on his Facebook page. "Thank you Mr President YK Museveni for the financial contribution of Shs30m to Case Hospital to cater for part of Mowzey Radio's medical bill. We are proud to have you as a father of our country, long live," read part of the post. "Thank you for listening and reacting to the request made to you by Balaam Barugahara, Bebe Cool, Goodlyfe management Team and Cathy Kusasira. Gwe asinga. Thank you on behalf of entertainment industry, friends and Mowzey Radio family," he added. On Friday last week, Socialite Brian White paid Shs25m towards Radio's treatment and further gave the management of the hospital 5million for their efforts in treating Radio. Radio who is currently receiving treatment at Case Hospital in Kampala was allegedly beaten into coma following a fight at De Bar, a local hang-out spot in Entebbe town a week ago. Police investigations into his beating is still underway.
