Africa's top musicians have taken to social media to hail Mowzey Radio as one of the greatest artistes Ugandan has produced. "You were a Man of great Talent and you will be missed," said Peter Okoye, while Paul said Mowzey was "Uganda's best vocalist." Peter and Paul Okoye are Nigerian Hip-hop twins of the once popular stage name Psquare. Another African music giant Wizkid also posted that "Nothing can ever be the same! 💔! My Superstar lives forever." Moses Ssekibogo aka Mowzey Radio of the Goodlyfe Crew was pronounced dead on Thursday at the intensive care unit at Case Hospital in Kampala, ten days after being beaten into a coma at a bar brawl in Entebbe on January 23.
