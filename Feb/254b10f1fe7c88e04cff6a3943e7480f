Supporters loyal to former president Robert Mugabe are challenging the legitimacy of President Emmerson Mnangagwa's administration and have sent a petition to the African Union and SADC leaders. They are requesting that a commission of inquiry be set up to probe the constitutionality of the change of leadership and have included the minutes of meetings held between Mugabe and General Chiwenga who led the coup before the former president stepped down.
