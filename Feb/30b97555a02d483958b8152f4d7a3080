A new global campaign to beat malaria - Malaria Must Die So Millions Can Live - has been launched on the web and online on social media. The campaign is backed by a coalition of global health and development organizations, including Malaria No More, and a number of celebrities.Â  The campaign kicked off with a video featuring footballer David Beckham, showing him in a glass box "under attack" by a swarm of mosquitoes. The campaign initially targets Commonwealth countries, where half of malaria deaths occur each year, but will expand after this year's Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which takes place in London in April.
