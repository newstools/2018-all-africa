Ugandan musician, Moses Ssekibogo, best known as Mowzey Radio of the Goodlyfe Crew was on Saturday laid to rest at his mother's home, Kagga in Nakawuka off Entebbe road with hundreds of mourners turning up to pay their last respects. Mowzey's body arrived at the burial grounds at about 10am amid tears from mourners. Some were seen covering their eyes perhaps to conceal the tears. Speeches were made by different people about the late and some of the notable ones came from singer Jose Chameleon who called on artistes to protect themselves, Pallaso, Weasel, Kenyan musician and Member of Parliament Charles Njagua aka Jaguar and Lilian Mbabazi (mother of two of Mowzey's children) among others. "We have lost a friend, a father. Moses, the hole you have left in our hearts and our lives will never be filled by any one," said Lillian Mbabazi. Burial had initially been slated for 4pm but his body was lowered into the grave at about 3pm. However, soon after the body had been lowered, chaos ensued with everyone, especially on the musicians' side at the grave exchanging fists. The mourners who had gathered at the grave dispersed in different directions with some getting trampled on in the stampede. Others fainted as they ran for their dear lives. Just when everyone thought it had settled, more chaos erupted resulting into some police officers getting injured. It is alleged that the chaos started when some of the mourners tried to grab the money that was being thrown into his grave. Radio died at Case Hospital in Kampala where he had been admitted after reportedly being beaten into coma at De Bar, a local hang-out spot in Entebbe town last week.
