Following the increased cases of crime rates across the country, the International Criminal Police Organisation, (INTERPOL), has partnered VoguePay, a leading online payment and security infrastructure provider for the design and delivery of its citizen-focused action and information portal for crime control in Nigeria. Aptly named InterPort, it is a platform to access information, manage stakeholder engagements and manage crime reporting. The multi-channel digital platform enables INTERPOL to improve citizen engagement and improve collaboration with its partner networks for control of crimes in Nigeria. Speaking on behalf of the agency, its Commissioner of Police in Nigeria, Olushola Subair noted that "the partnership with VoguePay would help the agency to increase the safety of Nigerians and to protect the economy while enabling citizens and businesses to comfortably embrace available technologies to grow their businesses, increase their profits and create more jobs." As the technology partner, VoguePay brings its experience in payment security and blockchain to implement a scalable, cross-agency blockchain-enabled data collaboration platform that delivers assurance of a trust less, virtual chain-of-evidence compatibility among all INTERPOL stakeholders. CEO of VoguePay, Michael Simeon, noted that "blockchain technology is the next evolution in identity management and that by leveraging blockchain, INTERPOL is now better positioned to offer cross-agency data and biometric collaboration with its key partners in Nigeria with a single version of the truth." The project will be delivered in phases by VoguePay with blockchain technology to improve access to information, manage stakeholder engagements and crime reporting for INTERPOL operations in Nigeria. VoguePay is a global online payment gateway that supports multi-currency transactions. Its Africa's first blockchain-powered digital banking platform is due to launch this year.
