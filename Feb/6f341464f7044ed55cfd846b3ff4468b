Following the death of Ugandan musician, Moses Ssekibogo, best known as Mowzey Radio of the Goodlyfe Crew on Thursday, president Museveni paid Shs20 million for his casket. This is in addition to Shs30 million that he contributed on Wednesday towards his treatment at case Hospital in Kampala before he died. The information we have also indicates that the president catered for food and drinks that were served at the singer's vigil at his home in Makindye (Makindye Nevaland). When the news of Mowzey's death started circulating, Mr Museveni tweeted saying: "I have been told about the untimely death of musician Moses Ssekibogo aka Mowzey Radio. I had only recently made a financial contribution towards his treatment and hoped he would get better. He was a talented young person with a great future ahead of him. May he rest in Peace." Mr Balaam Barugahare, an event's organiser said Mr Museveni would cater for everything until burial. "We shall not be mourning Radio because before he died, he said we should not cry but have a party so we are going to celebrate his life," Balaam said, adding that a stage will be put up in Nakawuuka where a few performances will take place. Radio is survived with three children; two of whom he had with fellow singer Lillian Mbabazi and another one with his white girlfriend. Radio died at Case Hospital in Kampala where he had been admitted after reportedly being beaten into at De Bar, a local hang-out spot in Entebbe town last week. Radio was part of the Tubonga Nawe project through which several musicians campaigned for President Museveni ahead of the February 2016 elections.
