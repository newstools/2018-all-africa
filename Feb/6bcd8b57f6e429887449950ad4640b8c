Nairobi â€” KENYAN forces have killed three al-Shabaab militants during anti-terror operations northeast of the country. Another insurgent was killed when an improvised explosive device he was planting on a road prematurely exploded. The success of the military in the Boni National Reserve follows sustained attacks at strongholds for the Islamic militants. Measuring more than 1 300 km2, the national reserve, is the main hideout of the insurgent group. "Some militants managed to escape into the forest. There were no casualties on the KDF side," said David Obonyo, the spokesperson of the Kenya Defense Forces (KDF). The troops recovered an assortment of weapons including AK 47 rifles, rounds of ammunition and bomb making material. Obonyo warned residents against providing assistance to the fleeing refugees. Al-Shabaab, which is based in Somalia, is carrying out attacks in neighbouring Kenya in response to the presence of Kenyan forces in the militants' country. Police earlier this week reported the terror group had beheaded some citizens in southern Somalia for allegedly spying for intelligence agencies in the two East African countries. - CAJ News
