Abuja â€” THE Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole, yesterday, said the Federal Government had concluded plans to roll out nationwide screening for most common types of cancers. The minister in a statement by Mrs Boade Akinola, Director Media and Public Relations of the ministry, also said individuals had roles to play to check cancer. Adewole spoke at a ceremony to mark the 2018 World Cancer Day, with the theme "We can, I can." According to the minister, the screening will be on the most common types of cancers, such as breast and cervical cancer in women and prostate cancer among men. He stated that this year's theme was geared towards exploring individual and collective drive in reducing the global burden of cancer. Adewole said individuals could play their role in fighting cancer through healthy lifestyle choices by engaging in weekly physical activities for at least two and half hours for adult, and an hour for children. He said other lifestyle modifications included avoiding tobacco smoking and eating a healthy diet, limiting alcohol intake and staying safe under the sun. Adewole also emphasised that high index of suspicion for early symptoms and signs of cancer were important, because finding cancer early makes it easier to treat and cure. The minister appealed to communities to dispel myths and misconceptions that led to stigma and discrimination against people living with the disease. Adewole said the commissioning of a new radiotherapy machine at National Hospital Abuja, recently, would provide easy access to radiation treatment for Nigerians.
