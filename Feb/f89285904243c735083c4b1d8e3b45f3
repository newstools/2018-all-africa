When he assumed office in November last year, President Emmerson Mnangagwa pledged rapid transformation of the economy and the general way of doing business in government, but in a video released on his Facebook page, he admits it has not been possible to achieve much under the given period. Apart from the partial repeal of a controversial indigenisation law that limited foreign ownership of local businesses to 49%, Mnangagwa says he has cut down unnecessary expenditure, including luxuries previously enjoyed by high-ranking public officials. He has also secured investment commitments worth U.S.$3 billion, among other achievements.
