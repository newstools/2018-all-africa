While water shortages have lead to prolonged droughts, authorities are building new long-distance pipelines and dams. A project is underway to provide water to cities and Blantyre, the country's business capital and second largest city, will receive water from the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve. This has been met with protests by residents who say they need the water for themselves.
