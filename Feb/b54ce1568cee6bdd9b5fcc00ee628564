Abuja â€” THE Nigerian Army has denied media report that it confirmed the escape of the factional leader of Boko Haram terrorists, Abubakar Shekau to Kolofata, in the neighbouring Republic of Cameroon. An online medium, SaharaReporters had reported that a "top Boko Haram commander, Abdullahi Bello alias Abu Zainab, who was captured by the Nigerian Army on February 14, disclosed to the Army interrogators that the wanted factional leader of the sect, Abubakar Shekau, escaped to Kolofata in neighbouring Cameroon. Responding to the report after Vanguard's enquiry, the Army through its spokesman,Brigadier General Sani Usman, insisted that the report was baseless, saying the such information never emanated from it. The Army statement read:"The attention of the Nigerian Army has been drawn to a news story on Sahara Reporters alleging that the wanted purported factional Boko Haram terrorists group leader, Abubakar Shekau, is in Kolofata, Republic of Cameroon. "Sahara Reporters is credited the source of such information to the Nigerian Army. According to the medium, it was alleged that "A top Boko Haram commander, Abdullahi Bello alias Abu Zainab, who was captured by the Nigerian Army on February 14, has disclosed that the wanted factional leader of the sect, Abubakar Shekau, has escaped to Kolofata in neighbouring Cameroon." "This is not true. The Nigerian Army did not arrest such person, neither do we have such suspect in our custody. " Contrary to the allegation on the medium, the Nigerian Army is not aware of the whereabouts of Abubakar Shekau hence the reward of the sum of N3 million Naira for any credible information on his whereabouts. "We would like to implore all persons particularly journalists to always authenticate or cross check their facts and information from the Nigerian Army before publication or circulating."
