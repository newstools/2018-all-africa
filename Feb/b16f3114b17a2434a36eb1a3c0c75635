Fallen Ugandan singer Mowzey Radio is said to have poured almost half a bottle of whisky onto revelers he was partying with moments before he met his death. This is according to David Washington, a famed music producer in Kampala. In an interview with the Ugandan media, Washington confesses to have spent the last five hours of Radio's normal life around him. Radio's actions of emptying the contents from a Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky on the table he was parting at is said to have angered the 'De Bar' club manager who was in attendance at the time, and is currently in custody. "(In the bar) Radio met like five people whom I have never met before," Washington is quoted by the Daily Monitor as saying. GOT ANGRY The five are believed to include one Hassan Lukwago, a Pamela, club manager George Egesa and Wamala. "I started seeing Mowzey's friends laughing at him. Mowzey got angry and poured alcohol on the manager, Egesa. Suddenly, Egesa got angry and smashed the bottles on the table," Washington says, but added that Mowzey and Egesa had to be pulled apart. "It was then that Egesa called bouncers to take Mowzey out and indeed they took him out. But on the way, Troy grabbed Mowzey and threw him down and he hit the head on the ground." Meanwhile, the state of Uganda's healthcare has also been criticised after Radio's demise. Washington reveals that he unsuccessfully shuttled with an injured Radio in an ambulance for hours and was even turned away from two hospitals before arriving at the Case Hospital. The revelation came as Uganda Police opened a murder file on the late singer's death, visited the scene of crime, and arriagned a suspect named Godfrey Wamala alias Troy at an Entebbe court.
