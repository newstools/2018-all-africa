Sauti Sol have incurred the wrath of Kenyans on social media in the wake of claims that they offered to pay the female models who would appear in upcoming video with food, bus fare and exposure. While Sauti Sol have since cancelled the said video shoot and apologised to their fans, on social media the award winning group has been subjected to heavy criticism and ridicule over the incident. The Melanin hit makers had on Wednesday made an announcement on social media requesting female models between the age of 18-25 years old from Nairobi to submit submit their full body and portrait shots for the shoot. However, on Friday the group found itself on the back foot when an email from one of the agencies they work with was leaked, detailing what the prospective models for the video shoot would be entitled to. We have been made aware of an email going around asking models to appear in a Sauti Sol dance video production for no compensation. The production email address it was sent from is often used by 3rd party contractors and in this case they clearly got it all wrong. pic.twitter.com/kfVAr2eiAn -- SAUTI SOL (@sautisol) February 2, 2018 (Continued) We believe in fair compensation for all work in the entertainment industry and do not condone the "exposure" speak. We believe our track record speaks for itself. Needless to say, we have terminated our contract with the production company involved. Apologies. pic.twitter.com/izRGE3U9PS -- SAUTI SOL (@sautisol) February 2, 2018 Inspite of the group's effort to explain the situation and even offer their apologies, Kenyans on Twitter were having none of it: My friend, a model, posted this 😭😭😭 Even after @sautisol have gone international they still "don't have a budget for their video" and will pay you by "opening many doors for you" This 👏🏾is 👏🏾trash!!!! and @sautisol productions 👏🏾this 👏🏾is a 👏🏾trash move!!! pic.twitter.com/iHUi3Kq9gk -- Wonder Woman (@n_kiunjuri) February 3, 2018 These dudes @sautisol are a major disappointment. Dudes making millions but paying nothing to their video models. This is extortion and you must be called out for it. Style up pic.twitter.com/Wn4Bl3LZjb -- Lord Mutai #Shithole (@ItsMutai) February 2, 2018 Lmao Sautisol, you are paying models with "food and transport" and when one reaches out anakulwa block 😁 pic.twitter.com/U5NFEgxBYX -- M O R A R A (@itsmorara) February 2, 2018 Leave alone Sauti Sol, most of these musicians don't pay models for their videos, they'll just provide alcohol so they get ratchet on the videos. Corporates also notorious for this 'exposure' slavery, invited to cover event only for coffee yet you advertised them. -- Kenya West© (@KinyanBoy) February 3, 2018 After all these fame and money and they cant pay models... .. Such a let down... .Sauti sol, I'm embarrassed that our sisters, relatives will appear in a video with nothing but bus fare. I hope the Melanin models got paid😧😧😧😧 -- Domicile herb (@domicileherb) February 3, 2018
