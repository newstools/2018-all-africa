ISAAC SSEJJOMBWE compiles some of his statements about his love life and music career. On career "Ugandan artistes are not working hard enough. If they were, we would quadruple our efforts. We have been at the same pace for four years and we are instead getting competition elsewhere, at the MTVs, Channel O awards etc." He was then quoted saying "We want people to enjoy us as individuals and as a group. We have many solo projects coming, we just want to give our fans the best," Radio said. On love I don't talk about my darling in the papers. She's special. She needs her private life. At some point, it was reported that Lilian and Mowzey had separated but he came out and said, "Lilian is still my wife, and she will be forever and ever. Haters can go hang." He also gave her a shout outs at some promotion saying "Oh, this phone is by Lilian Mbabazi... beautiful. Please support her and buy the phone."
