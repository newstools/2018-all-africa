Gospel artist Bahati was over the weekend on the firing line for refusing to embrace his wife's changed physique after she had just given birth. Weight gain is a normal part of pregnancy and new mothers often have to wait for months before shedding off the baby fat. Bahati had shared after-pregnancy photos of his wife Diana Marua as she lay in a hospital bed at Karen Hospital. Diana did not have make-up, looked puffed up and a bit darker, a contrast from her airbrushed photos on social media. The photos elicited ridicule after many fans contrasted the before and after-pregnancy photos of Diana. Bahati, instead of standing proud of his wife natural looks, succumbed to pressure and quickly deleted the photos, but not before netizens had taken screenshots. He was soon roasted for not appreciating the physical changes his woman went through to bring forth their daughter. Diana, in her quick defense, shared a photo taken during her maternity photoshoot captioning, "Puffed Nose 😂 puffed face 😩 puffed everything 🤡 but all worth it 💯." She went on to use the hashtags #BabyWeight #Worthit before blocking all fans who shared negative comments. Days later Diana embraced her womanhood and shared an all-natural look photo of her leaving the hospital after delivery. Thank you guys @arrowbwoy @magix_enga @kioko_kioks for the hospital visits, all the emotional support and coming to pick @heavenbahati and I from hospital after being discharged 🤗I can't say thank you enough @krgthedon for the immense support! @bahatikenya You are more than our #TENOVERTEN 😉😘Bless you all 🤗😊#letthejourneybegin #newmommy #noepiduralformotherhood #BabyWeight #Worthit #grateful #blessed A post shared by Mrs Bahati (@diana_marua) on Feb 18, 2018 at 10:48am PST Bahati has however steered clear of Diana's after baby photos choosing to instead share her pregnancy look. Here are some of the comments; kui.carol wrote on Instagram, "Make up helps 😝" alicia_john commented, "Congrats baby weight is normal and as u have said very worth it... especially when u hold ur baby in ur arms." Tess Humphrey wrote on Facebook, "Sambary give the make-up artist an award already!" Carol Kamau commented, "Ladies, who doesn't know people change during pregnancy and after delivery stop cyberbullying."
