Abeokuta â€” No fewer than eight persons were roasted to death, yesterday, as a loaded fuel tanker burst into flames after being hit by a container-laden truck. A source at the scene of the accident at Onigari village, close to Foursquare Gospel Church camp at Ajebo, along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, explained that the tanker carrying 33,000 litres of petrol was said to be travelling to Ibadan, while the container-laden truck was coming from Ibadan, when the accident occurred. Confirming the incident, the Public Relations Officer, Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps, Babatunde Akinbiyi, said the accident occurred at a point where the traffic had been diverted to a single lane. He said the tanker caught fire when the truck hit it on the side and the petrol in it started gushing out. Akinbiyi explained that the situation was made worse as the truck had some passengers in the container attached to it. His words: "Eight persons have been confirmed dead in the inferno; they were roasted beyond recognition. "The victims were those passengers in the container attached to the truck." Akinbiyi said the accident caused a gridlock on the Ajebo-Ogunmakin axis of the road, because it took sometime before the fire was put out. He added that operatives of the Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, State Fire Service and the Police were equally on ground to manage the traffic, and remove the charred bodies and vehicles from the road.
