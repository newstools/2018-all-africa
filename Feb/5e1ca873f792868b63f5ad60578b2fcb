Irish singer-songwriter Chris de Burgh will light up the night at the Grand West Arena on Wednesday, 28 February 2018 and at the Time Square Sun Arena on Friday, 2 March 2018. Few artists can boast a pedigree of hit songs that span across four decades; songs like Just Another Poor Boy , Don't Pay the Ferryman , A Spaceman Came Travelling and the show stopping The Lady in Red have made him a household name. Besides being a regular tour favourite here, South Africa holds a special place in de Burgh's heart as it was one of the first countries to embrace his unique style of musical story telling. He first visited the country in 1976 in support of his Spanish Train and Other Stories album.
