Muluzi said despite efforts being made. Malawi still faces challenges in its health system including a double burden from infectious and non- infectious diseases, coupled with limited resources for health. "Our human resource base is lean, so too the need to improve the infrastructure and medical equipment for the delivery of health services, I am aware that China has developed a lot of innovative ways and resilience in developing their country and people's health. "It is therefore critical for the development of our people that China assists Malawi in the health sector," he said.
