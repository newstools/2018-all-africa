For months now her face has been on every TV station asking for help for her much needed treatment in Atlanta, United States. Njambi Koikai who is suffering from Thoracic Endometriosis - a condition which causes her lungs to collapse regularly- needed Sh10 million for treatment in the US. On Thursday, she thanked everyone who came in to her aid as she headed to United States for treatment. "I love you all for supporting this fight. We are just about to score the goal to wellness. Thank you for supporting me. Thank you for loving me and may God bless each one of you," she wrote on her Facebook page. NEEDS MORE HELP She added that she still needs more help because the Sh10 million target for her treatment has not been reached. "We haven't reached the target yet but God is providing. God has brought us this far." Ms Koikai was accompanied in her flight by her mother and a nurse. Njambi also gave details of the treatement via Instagram. "The specialised treatment in the US entails a surgery to remove endometrial lesions in my lungs. I have undergone more than ten surgeries and this is happening every month," she wrote. Several concerts were held by Kenyan entertainers to raise funds for her treatment after news of her illness hit the press in late 2016. 'The Trend' presenter Njambi Koikai in need of your help
