A photo of French President Emmanuel Macron and musician Rihanna has excited the internet. The two were snapped embracing and it was the President's eyes on Rihanna that got people talking. President Macron's eyes were all along fixed on Rihanna even as she looked away after the hug. His grasp on the Work singer with both hands and warm smile were also a subject of discussion. Users wrote how the 40-year-old President was ready to risk it all with his 67-year-old wife Brigitte. Ladies: do not get you a man that looks at you how Macron looks at Rihanna. It might be uncomfortable. ðŸ™ˆ pic.twitter.com/SUk3UMW7BU -- Chanda Mbao (@ChandaMbao) February 4, 2018 French President Emmanuel Macron looks like he is ready to risk it all. pic.twitter.com/OFmaLRqAxx -- Makho Ndlovu (@makhondlovu) February 3, 2018 Emmanuel Macron looking at rihanna as if she was a "pain au chocolat" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’€ pic.twitter.com/LAXGY3ebQA -- phuckyoprideðŸ’Š (@hamsjalloh) February 4, 2018 President Macron and Rihanna were attending the conference "GPE Financing Conference, an Investment in the Future" in Dakar on Friday, as part of Macron's visit to Senegal.
