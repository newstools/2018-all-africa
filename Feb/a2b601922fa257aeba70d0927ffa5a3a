Ethiopian Airlines, the national carrier, has procured an Airbus full flight simulator for 20 million dollars. The Airline imported full flight simulators for the Airbus A350 aircraft it had received in 2016. The procurement is expected to save foreign currency it has been paying to train its pilots in Toulouse, France. The machines are fitted with complete electrical motion systems which save energy and have a low impact on the environment, Tewolde Gebremariam, Group CEO of Ethiopian Airlines said during the inaugural ceremony held last Friday. Ethiopian has invested 125 million dollars over the past seven years to expand and upgrade all the facets of its training capabilities. The Pilot Training School of the Airline has trained pilots from over 52 countries, in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Europe for around half a century. Ethiopian Airlines, an aviation holding comprised of Ethiopian Express & Ancillary Services, Ethiopian International Services, Ethiopian Cargo Services, Ethiopian MRO Services, Ethiopian Aviation Academy, ET In-flight Catering, and Ethiopian Ground Services, currently operates seven Airbus aircrafts, with 17 more on the way. It also owns simulators for Boeing aircrafts and Bombardiers.
