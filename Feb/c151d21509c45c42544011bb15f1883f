High flying musician Mukudzei Mukombe aka Jah Prayzah is dominating upcoming National Merit Awards with nominations in three categories. Running in its 17th edition, the event will take place on February 17 at Reps Theatre in Belgravia. The most contentious battle is between undeniably man of the moment Jah Prayzah and urban grooves musician Trevor Dongo who clash in the Outstanding Male Musician category together with X-Q. The two also lock horns in Outstanding Album category with their respective albums "Kutonga Kwaro" and "Beyond". The "Kutonga Kwaro" hit-maker has also been nominated in the Outstanding Song of the Year category for the song "Ndini Ndamubata", where it is competing with Ammara Brown's "Akiliz" and "Pamamonya Ipapo" by Soul Jah Love. Ammara is also competing with gospel artist Janet Manyowa and Selmor Mtukudzi in the Outstanding Female Musician category. Visually-impaired actress Edith Masango has been nominated in the Outstanding Actress under Theatre category for her role in "Narratives from the Dark" and is battling with Charlene Mangweni in "The Incident" and "Nomvuyiso Mabi" in Double Funeral According to Nama chairperson Professor Ruby Magosvongwe the adjudicators bemoaned lack of creativity in the quality and quantity of work submitted to them under dance, film and music. "Most submissions of music videos lack imagination and creativity. Many artists do not invest in hiring producers as they prefer to produce and direct the filming of the video by themselves. This compromised the quality of the submitted film product. "Most traditional dance practitioners are not creating new works that are evident of innovation and creativity," she said.
