Rising sungura musician David Hatie Chipuwe has promised to up his game this year in the most celebrated genre in showbiz and lure more musical fans to his brand. Chipuwe announced his arrival in the music sector with his debut album titled "Mwari Munotendwa" in 2014. It received a lukewarm response due to poor marketing. He went on to release another album last year titled "Nhaka" which received fair airplay. In an interview the musician said he has since shifted from digital recording to live recording to enrich his music. "My first two albums were recorded digitally but my fans and other music gurus advised me to record live if I am to have a successful career in sungura and I heeded that call," he said. Chipuwe who is currently in the studio is set to release his first live recorded single "Kumira Mira" in April. "I am encouraging my fans to look forward to my new single that will be released in April. The song encourages family members to do their best to remain united despite their differences. I have seen a lot of families disbanding because of differences," he said. He added that the song would be accompanied by a video. Chipuwae who is also a member of Zimbabwe Business and Arts Hub (Zibah) draws inspiration from societal issues. "Most of songs come from what I witness on a day to day basis and in different environments that I visit. I tackles issues that affects relationships, families among other issues," he said. Chipuwe thanked Zibah for helping him increase his brand's visibility. "I really want to appreciate all the support that I have been receiving from Zibah. They have helped me with exposure because I get to perform at various gatherings and my brand is growing because of that," he said. Zibah has assisted a number of musicians that include Paradzai Mesi to revive his career and Nicholas Zakaria to launch his album.
