At 6am Thursday morning, one of Uganda's best vocalists Mowzey Radio passed on at Case clinic after spending 10 days in coma. Radio, real names Moses Ssekibogo, was part of a music duo called Goodlyf. For more than ten years, the two produced music that touched and moved millions across the world. Before his death, people had already speculated that that was the end of Weasel's career. We, however, beg to disagree because for starters, Weasel's breakthrough song Bomboclat, produced alongside his brother Jose Chameleon, was a hit. ROUGH-VOICED The rough-voiced singer has also had some solo projects that worked well. We are talking about songs like Wiggle Wiggle, Olina work alongside Grenade, Wine with Anita Da Diva and his latest I'm dying. Radio's death is without a doubt going to affect Weasel and we can only imagine what is going through his mind right now but he will definitely soldier on and will thrive. According to Weasel, they were having evening tea before Radio told him he was going to Entebbe to inspect his building. "I told Mowzey not to go to Entebbe that day because I had a bad feeling about his journey," Weasel said, adding that if he had stayed or moved with him, none of this would have happened.
