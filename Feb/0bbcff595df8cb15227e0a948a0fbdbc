Cape Town residents who failed to comply with the recently introduced level 6B water restrictions have been issued U.S.$333 in fines, law enforcement officials said. Under the new restrictions, water consumption is limited to 50 litres per person per day. This comes as the city rushes to get a temporary desalination plant operational as uncertainty remains over rainfall patterns.
