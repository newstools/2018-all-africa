Seven year-old Emmanuella Samuel, popular for the comedy skit "This is Not My Real Face Oh" has landed a Disney acting role. The young comedienne has gained a large following throughout the world. We wish her all the best in her career. Small beginnings sometimes lead one to big places. The case of popular Nigerian child comedienne Emmanuella Samuel, who is popularly called Emmanuella, easily comes to mind. The seven year old who turns eight in July started out her entertainment career by featuring in the Mark Angel Comedy. Mark Angel Comedy discovered Emmanuella through the acting school run by the Mark Angel foundation. Unlike other comedy skits that are produced in affluent places, Mark produced his comedy in the environment he found himself in. Emmanuella however started acting in Mark Angel comedy when she was five years old and only in primary one (grade one). Emmanuella received wide acclaim around the world after the comedy skit "This is Not My Real Face Oh" went viral. The video has currently been viewed over 4 million times on YouTube. The Mark Angel Comedy channel has over 1.7 million subscribers, with videos gaining 1 million views within a week. Emmanuella has been recipient of various awards both within and outside Nigeria. In Australia she was awarded the Princess of Comedy and Prominent Kid Comedienne awards. A recent post on Instagram from an unverified Emmanuella account said, "Thanks @disneystudios God bless everyone whose support has added to bringing us here. I never dreamed of being here so soon. I miss Success. I love you all." Congratulatory messages have been pouring out both from the general public and Nigerian politicians. The Nigerian Senate President Bukola Saraki said in a Twitter post "your story is an inspiration. Come by the Nigerian Senate sometime, let's discuss how we can develop the potential of our young talents in the creative industry."
