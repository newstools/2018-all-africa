A document implicating Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i in the controversial deportation of lawyer Miguna Miguna has emerged online. The document, which has since been shared multiple times on social media and which bears Dr Matiang'i's signature, is a purported declaration of Miguna's removal from Kenya to his country of origin Canada. The document reads in part: "In exercising powers vested to him by Section 43(1) of the Kenyan Citizenship and Immigration Act 2011 do hereby declare that Miguna Miguna who is not a citizen of Kenya and whose presence in Kenya is contrary to the national interest, be removed from Kenya to his country of origin Canada." AUTHENTICITY "And further direct that Miguna Miguna remain in prison custody while arrangements for removal are being undertaken. And this warrant is sufficient warrant to keep the said Miguna Miguna in custody," the document signed by Matiang'i on February 6, 2018 further states. Nairobi News could however not independently verify the authenticity of the said document. Mr Miguna, who had been under police custody since Friday, was kicked out of the country on Tuesday night having been arraigned in a court in Kajiado earlier in the day.
