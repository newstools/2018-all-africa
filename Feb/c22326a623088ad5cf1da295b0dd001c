The shocking conditions in which over 100 mentally and physically challenged patients lived at unlicensed non-governmental organisations, having being moved from the Life Esidimeni facilities, came to light after they died. Hearings led by retired judge Dikgang Moseneke heard harrowing tales of abuse and neglect. Family members who tried convincing the Department of Health not to move their loved ones, were ignored, while government officials denied responsibility and shifted blame. Over 140 patients died while over 60 others have still not been found.
