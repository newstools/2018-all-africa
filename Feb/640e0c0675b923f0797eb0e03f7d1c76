Rwandan filmmaker Samuel Ishimwe took home the Silver Bear Jury Prize in the short film category for his film, Imfura, at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival.Â  Imfura tells the story of Gisa, a young man who travels to the village of his mother, who disappeared in the genocide. He finds himself in the midst of a family conflict over the fate of the ruins of a house his mother had built. Caught between the contradictions of a changing society, Gisa, who is almost the same age as the new Rwanda, seeks to rediscover his share of the collective memory of a past that belongs to him.
