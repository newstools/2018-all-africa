Controversial Chief Executive Officer Matshela Koko has resigned from Eskom. The power utility has been at the centre of controversy for years, consistently running at a huge financial loss with the government forced to provide bailouts. Eskom has also been at the centre of gross mismanagement and maladministration, with several of its Board and chief executive officers being fired or replaced. Eskom has also appeared before various parliamentary portfolio committees on the state of business at the parastatal.
