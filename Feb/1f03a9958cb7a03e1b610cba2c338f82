Papi, the long-awaited Belgium-France-Uganda co-production film set in Uganda and featuring a predominantly local cast is set to premiere at Theatre Labonita in Kampala this Tomorrow, Thursday. The multilingual thriller revolves around its titular character Papi, a Congolese dandy who finds work as a boda boda rider in Kampala. His life is however turned upside-down when he crosses paths with a troubled woman and a duplicitous Belgian expat. Papy Tshifuaka, a Congolese actor and real life member of the world-famous fashion cult the Sepeurs plays the titular character while Belgian film star Fredrik Declercq is the villain. The film's Ugandan cast includes actors like Rehema Nanfuka, Daniel Omara, Felix Bwanika, Wilberforce Mutete and Radio/TV personality Deedan Muyira. The film was shot on location in Kampala back in 2015 with the $15,000 (about Shs 54.5m) budget film being mainly funded through an elaborate crowd-funding campaign that saw money raised through online contributions and other forms of fundraisers in Belgium and France. The film's Belgian writer and director Kjell Clarysse told hopes that the Ugandan audiences will enjoy the film as much as the European audiences did. "We had a great time filming in Uganda with the local cast and crew, and I hope the audiences here appreciate the film as much as the ones back in Europe did," he said, revealing that the film enjoyed rave reviews when it debuted in Brussels in May last year. Tickets to the premiere cost Shs 20,000 and will be sold at Theatre Labonita box office on the D-Day. Gates open at 7pm.
