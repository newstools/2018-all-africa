President Museveni has mourned Ugandan musician Moses Ssekibogo, best known as Mowzey Radio of the Goodlyfe Crew who died Thursday morning. In his condolence message, Mr Museveni said: "I have been told about the untimely death of musician Moses Ssekibogo aka Mowzey Radio. I had only recently made a financial contribution towards his treatment and hoped he would get better. He was a talented young person with a great future ahead of him. May he rest in Peace." The president on Wednesday contributed Shs30m towards the treatment of Radio at Case Hospital where he had been hospitailised for more than a week following injuries he sustained in a bar fight. Radio died at Case Hospital in Kampala where he had been admitted after reportedly being beaten into at De Bar, a local hang-out spot in Entebbe town last week. Radio was part of the Tubonga Nawe project through which several musicians campaigned for President Museveni ahead of the February 2016 elections.
