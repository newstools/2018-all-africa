Masters Security of Malawi bowed out with some pride after playing out a goalless draw with Angolan giants, Petro de Luanda, at Bingu National Stadium in Lilongwe on Tuesday afternoon. The odds were stacked against Masters in this second-leg of the preliminary round after a 5-0 loss in the first-leg played at 11 Novembre Stadium in Luanda last week. But Masters, who threw more men in attack, showed strong character in front of a partisan home crowd. However, the hosts were let down by strikers Juma Yatina and Vincent Nyangulu's poor finishing as they failed to trouble Petro goalkeeper Gerson. From the first whistle, it was clear that Petro, who date SuperSport United of South Africa in the next round 5-0 on aggregate, were in Lilongwe just to defend their lead. Masters were making their debut in the continental competition, barely a season after earning promotion to Malawi's top-flight league. After the final whistle, Masters coach Abasi Makawa was happy with the performance of his charges but not the result whereas his opposite number Beto Bianchi lauded his charges for sailing through.
