Ibadan â€” Oyo State Government has said that 12,000 metric tonnes of UREA/NPK fertilizer will be available at a subsidized rate to the farmers in the state for the next planting season. The government said it is imperative to prepare ahead for the next planting season, saying that the move is to boost farm products and increase yield in the state. The State Commissioner for Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development, Prince Oyewole Oyewumi disclosed that the state is expecting the supply of 8,000 metric tonnes of NPK fertilizer under the Federal Government Special Fertilizer Intervention Programme. The Commissioner, speaking through the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Victor Atilola, stressed that there is an ongoing process by the State Government to procure 4,000 metric tonnes of UREA fertilizer to be sold to farmers at a subsidized rate. Prince Oyewumi noted that the present administration in the State is working earnestly to ensure food security, enhance farm products as well as boost the State economy, explaining that the fertilizer will be available in all the eight warehouses and the Farm Service Centres where agricultural inputs are being sold in the State. The Commissioner while speaking on the purchase of agrochemical said that government decided to concentrate on the procurement of fertilizers and not agrochemicals because farmers could easily access the crop protection products in their locality.
