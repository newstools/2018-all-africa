President Cyril Ramaphosa concluded his inaugural "State of the Nation" address to Parliament by reciting the lyrics of the song, "Send Me/ Thuma Mina", by Hugh Masekela. The phrase, based on a biblical passage and deeply rooted in South Africa's choral tradition, has swept the nation, prompting many to send Ramaphosa messages saying simply, "Send Me". Professor Tinyiko MalulekeÂ explains the origins of the song and unpacks its connotations of service to the nation after an era during which, he writes, President Jacob Zuma "was averse to taking personal responsibility and appeared incapable of countenancing personal sacrifice." And in a few of the dozens of video clips which can be found on YouTube, choirs and musical groups showcase the many versions of the song.
